**"I went to work, and I talked to her around 8 o'clock and that's the last time I talked to her," said Shane Carey, the father of Broussard's children. He says both Broussard and their two-week-old daughter Margot were nowhere to be found when he got home at 2 p.m., he then called police.**    
    
Friday, we talked to him at a T-Mobile store, where he was trying to get cell phone records -- anything he says to get Heidi and Margot back. "If you see an awesome mom with a baby walking around or in a suspicious van or car or anything, please just somebody call," Carey pleaded.

“[SBM]    
    
An Austin Police Department press release says that Broussard, 33, and Carey were last seen around 7:30 a.m. at Cowan Elementary School, located along 2817 Kentish Drive. Broussard was dropping off a child at the school. Police believe that Broussard and Carey returned to their home close to West William Cannon and South First Street.    
    
[SBM]    
    
Shane Carey, the father of Margot, [told CBS Austin](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/austin-dad-pleads-for-safe-return-of-his-two-week-old-daughter-her-mother) that he last spoke to Broussard around 8 a.m. on December 12. Carey said that he returned home from work around 2 p.m. and found that Broussard and his daughter were not there.    
    
Carey says he then received a phone call from Cowan Elementary School to say that the couple’s son had not been picked up. Carey went to pick up his child at the school. When he returned home and Broussard still wasn’t there, Carey called the police. CBS Austin noted that when they spoke to him, Carey was at a T-Mobile store attempted to get Broussard’s cell phone records. Carey told the station, ‘If you see an awesome mom with a baby walking around or in a suspicious van or car or anything, please just somebody call.’ ^jvonk  
    
Carey [told KVUE,](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/austin-police-search-missing-mom-baby/269-e246b008-1502-4912-afe8-19c8285e16ad) ‘I don’t know why anybody would ever harm or touch these two beautiful women together.’ Carey said, ‘She is an amazing person. She has amazing support, friends behind her. She’s so personable – one of the best people I’ve ever met, so kind, and she does anything for her kids – one of the best moms.’    
    
Carey went on, ‘We’re all stumped because everything’s over here – the car’s over here. There’s no signs of struggle. There’s nothing, no evidence, so we’re just trying to piece it together but there really are no pieces.’ Carey also told the station that he and Broussard have two children together and that he has another child from a previous marriage.    
    
[CBS Austin reports](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/austin-dad-pleads-for-safe-return-of-his-two-week-old-daughter-her-mother) Broussard worked at a Cracker Barrel in Buda, Texas. Broussard has worked at the location since 2015. Co-workers told the station that Broussard has been off work since giving birth on November 26 ^9g91f

KXAN reports that authorities said Broussard and her 2-week-old daughter, Margot, likely [returned home](https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/mom-and-2-week-old-baby-missing-last-seen-in-south-austin/) afterward, at the Club at Summer Valley apartments off of West William Cannon Drive and South First Street, but at some point, disappeared. The apartment complex is around three miles away from the elementary school.    
    
At around 6 p.m., the elementary school contacted the boy’s father, Shane Carey, and said no one picked the child up. Carey, who is also the father of Margot, subsequently contacted 911.

“It’s just the only thing gone is [Broussard] the baby, her keys and her cellphone, which has been off since I tried to call her at 1:40,” Carey said.    
    
Carey, says he is working around the clock to find answers. “Not knowing what to do is the hardest part. I don’t know where she’s at, I don’t know if she’s suffering, I don’t know anything, and I can’t help. I’m helpless, and that’s the worst feeling in the world, is to be helpless.”    
    
He is asking the public, to share their case, “It only takes one second for her family to be happy, just one second.”

“That’s the worst feeling in the world,” Carey told KTBC. “Not knowing what to do is the hardest part. I don’t know where she’s at, I don’t know if she is suffering. I just want to do more. It feels like we could do more.”    
    
Between tears, Carey described the mother of his baby girl as “beautiful” and “loving,” and called the circumstances surrounding her disappearance “weird.”    
    
[…]    
    
Carey claims he went inside, found the baby’s car seat and Broussard’s keys, and thought nothing of it at first, believing she was at a friend’s house nearby.    
    
But as the hours passed, and he was still unable to reach Broussard by phone, Carey said he called all her friends, who also hadn’t heard from her. That’s when he called 911.    
    
[…]    
    
In the interview, Carey said he’s aware that people may be casting a suspicious eye in his direction.    
    
“I just pretty much ignore that,” he explained. “I know it’s a question. I don’t … I don’t know, I just ignore it. It’s not true. It’s negative.”    
    
[…]    
    
“She’s a great person,” he said. “She needs to be back. Her son needs her, I need her — her family needs her.”

- Police have said they believe Broussard returned home with Margot sometime before her fiancé, Shane Carey, reported them missing around 7.30pm that night  
- Carey has issued multiple pleas for the pair's return in tearful TV interviews  
- In a FOX7 interview published Sunday, Carey addressed facing scrutiny over Broussard's disappearance and insisted that he hadn't done anything wrong ^mabz9  
- 'I try to ignore that, I don't know how to handle it. But I know it's a question. I just ignore it,' he said. 'I know it's not true. It's negative'  
- Authorities have not offered an update in the search since Friday, and it is unclear whether Carey is being treated as a person of interest  
- Carey's father Ty Carey set up a Facebook page Sunday morning to raise money for a reward and for 'expenses incurred during the search' ^hvk6f

"It is without a doubt something that concerns the whole community. There is great concern from our team. We want to make sure there is every last resource that applies," said Brandon Goering, TEXSAR board vice chairman.    
    
The non-profit offers trained search teams and cadaver dogs plus consulting services for law enforcement agencies. "We provide consultation as far as lost person behavior," said Goering. "There's a lot of science and statistics that go into the different lost person behavior types."    
    
In order for the agency to step in, APD would have to request for their help. Something he says hasn't happened yet. "Quite often when they get a narrowed search area and some place that they can apply those assets, that's when we will be called in," Goering said.

According to Austin Police, detectives are actively working the case and haven't been able to step away to give on-camera interviews.    
    
Volunteer agency, Texas Search and Rescue says they have not been called to assist in the search. "Quite often when they get a narrowed search area or someplace where they can apply those assets that's when we'll be called in," says TEXSAR Vice President Brandon Goering.

Despite silence from law enforcement, he's confident investigators are leaving no stone unturned. "This is different in that it seems that there are a lot of details that law enforcement is exploring that rightfully so isn't privy to the general public," says Goering.    
    
Monday evening, CBS Austin spoke with Heidi's mother Tammy over the phone. Tammy says she's in Austin actively searching for Heidi and Margot -- she says despite social media speculation there have been no changes in the case.

- Investigators said they are trying to remain neutral and not jump to any conclusions. ^y0wi5  
- They are working the case from two possible angles: that HB left on her own and that they are victims of foul play. ^88633  
- LE is scouring forensic data and conducting on-the-ground investigation, including interviewing all of HB's close friends and family and in some cases building a timeline of their whereabouts and alibis.  
- Investigators are also looking at hours and hours of video, not only from the apt. complex but also from nearby businesses.  
- They have knocked on every door in the complex to interview neighbors and they have done an analysis of the apartment for any possible forensic evidence. ^tuait  
- So far, investigators say they haven't turned up anything that firmly indicates anything one way or another. ^-rgi8  
- The entire [Homicide Cold Case/Missing Persons Unit](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/homicide-cold-case) of the APD – a total of about 7 investigators – is investigating this case and as of Mon night, they have asked for and gotten help from outside law enforcement as well.

For an AMBER Alert to be issued in Texas, the case must meet the following [list of criteria](https://www.dps.texas.gov/intelligenceCounterTerrorism/Alerts/AmberOverview.htm) defined by the [Texas Department of Public Safety](https://www.dps.texas.gov/):    
  
- Is this child 17 years of age or younger, whose whereabouts are unknown and whose disappearance law enforcement has determined to be unwilling which poses a credible threat to the child's safety and health? And if abducted by a parent or legal guardian, was the abduction in the course of an attempted murder or committed murder? or  
- Is this child 13 years of age or younger, who was taken – willingly or unwillingly – without permission from the care and custody of a parent or legal guardian by 1) someone unrelated and more than three years older or 2) another parent or legal guardian who attempted or committed murder at the time of the abduction?  
- Is this child in immediate danger of sexual assault, death or serious bodily injury?  
- Has a preliminary investigation verified the abduction and eliminated alternative explanations for the child's disappearance?  
- Is sufficient information available to release to the public to help locate the child, a suspect or the vehicle used in the abduction?

Tuesday, FBI agents were seen combing Heidi's apartment complex and interviewing neighbors.    
    
[…]    
    
The Broussards traveled from Lake Charles, Louisiana last week after Heidi's fiancé Shane called to tell them she and Margot were missing. They tell us **they're getting regular updates from investigators** and have faith that Heidi and Margot will return home.    
    
[…]    
    
However, the Broussard's are adamant Heidi would not leave her son -- they're positive something isn't right. "Heidi wouldn't do this, there's no way. She loves her son Silas and she would never do this -- and she would never take Margot down those stairs without her carrier and have her strapped in and her diaper bag strapped to her back," says Tammy.    
    
Right now, **Heidi's car remains in the parking lot**. **Police have locked down her apartment** and haven't specified what items, if any, are missing.

During a conversation in May, according to the friend, Heidi spoke about her living arrangements. Foster said Heidi wanted to move to a vacant home in Kyle, Texas, that belongs to Carey’s father. The friend said she had no idea that Heidi never moved to the home, and was surprised to hear she was still living in her Austin apartment. ^xf8g6  
    
Foster added that Heidi planned to drive her son 40 minutes each way from Tyler to a school in Austin so that the child could stay in a good school. ^785vv

“She was willing to drive 40 minutes out of her way to have them in a better school. That’s not a mother that leaves…..I feel like everybody is focusing on her running away and knowing Heidi I doubt that.” ^nkaix  
    
CrimeOnline spoke with the Austin Police Department’s Cold Case Missing Persons’ Unit, who confirmed that the friend informed them of Heidi’s plans to move to a house 40 minutes away from her Austin apartment. ^xodo3  
    
The friend said she was also surprised when Heidi told over the summer that she had gotten back together with Carey. The pair had apparently previously broken up, according to the friend. ^dbytz

Further, the friend said Carey’s recent behavior after Heidi disappeared differed from his previous behavior, when he allegedly showed up to her house almost immediately after Heidi didn’t answer her phone. ^30dkd

KVUE can reveal authorities have set up a command post at a police substation in South Austin to coordinate efforts by a growing number of state, federal and local investigators.    
    
By Wednesday, members of the FBI's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment team were in Austin. The team, which as been in place for more than a decade, has about 60 agents from across the country, who have special skills in finding missing children.    
    
Investigators have been divided into teams to help review forensic evidence, including hours of video footage from security cameras throughout the area and to continue interviewing those who know Broussard.    
    
`[…]`    
    
Investigators are scouring forensic data and conducting on-the-ground investigation, including interviewing all of Broussard's close friends and family and in some cases building a timeline of their whereabouts and alibis around the time Broussard and the baby disappeared.    
    
`[…]`    
    
Investigators are also looking at hours and hours of video, not only from the South Austin apartment complex where Broussard lives but also from nearby businesses. They tell KVUE they have knocked on every door in the complex to interview neighbors and they have done an analysis of the apartment for any possible forensic evidence.

**Transcript of first full Fox7 interview with SC:** ^lr-fp  
    
Reporter is on the phone conducting the interview. In the room with Shane is at least one cameraman, and probably at least one second reporter or news staff person. Possibly his Dad is there also. I can’t tell who is there, and I can’t tell who in the room is talking, so I have labelled them “Reporter” for the woman on the phone, and “Camerman/Reporter2” for the other people talking in the room with SC.    
    
Reporter: `<unintelligible>`    
    
SC: Yes it's my fiancee, yes ma'am. Yeah I look down when I talk I'm sorry I'm only looking down the whole time probably.    
    
Reporter: .. what kind of day was it...`<unintelligible>`    
    
SC: Just a basic Thursday, we have basically have a routine every day. I get up around 6:00 a.m. and pretty much hit the snooze button a couple times and then I finally wake up around 6:15, drink some water, uh, wake up the kids around 6:30, wake up Heidi and Silas right before I leave, uh. So like once I got them up on Thursday it's kind of a later morning it was around 6:40 whenever I got them up and cause it was Heidi's first day to actually take Margot by herself with uh Silas so first gave Heidi kiss, the baby kissm and Silas a kill, said 'have a wonderful day', left the Apartments, went to work and then she takes her kids to school and she she was making lunch like right before I left, uh. Uh, she took the kids school so, I don't know, ah. Uh so at around 8 o'clock she called me, answered the phone like right before I got in my truck, I work for Unicorn Moving, so she called me around 8:00 and she told me that she went to the book fair, she bought three books, costs about $25, it was amazing that she couldn't wait to read to Silas and I told her ‘I love you goodbye’ and uh… This is hard.    
    
Reporter: Take your time    
    
SC: Yeah. So uh… Oh man. I don’t know right now. I’ve just been repeating it all day    
    
Reporter: Let me know if you want me to move on to another subject    
    
SC: No, no it's a good question, it’s just that we’re in a situation right here. So I don’t know. I don’t know, she’s just an amazing mom. I don't know. Pause. I don’t know. I need to stand up, I don’t know, I can't sit here, this is making me so … I feel funny.

Camerman/Reporter2: Yeah, something like that, yeah, yeah.    
    
SC: Four or five years. We came from Louisiana, long story short my ex-wife with my beautiful daughter Addison came down here as soon as my dad got cancer. He's cancer freed now, that’s not the main story but yeah. So we were on the pipeline traveling so we had to come down here so we moved back to Austin, all my family's here so.

SC: Uh there's nobody now where this is, we have a loving and great family, Heidi has great friends, she is the most awesome person in the world, loving mom, she supports everything everybody does, she could have like four dollars in the bank account and just still want to give. So she's a great person, so is Margo our beautiful three week old daughter, so uh yeah. There's no no enemies there's there's nothing that would be negative or anybody would want to harm us at all.

Reporter: The morning Heidi went missing, did her demeanor seem any different? Or was it, you know, just like a regular day for her too?    
    
SC: It was a regular day so like what I was trying    
    
Camerman/Reporter2: Make sure `<?>` that phone down a little bit?    
    
SC: Oh. OK. So like what I was trying to explain it was a normal day, it was uh I woke up at six like I pretty much do my thirty minutes of my routine right before I get them up, they get a little extra 30 minutes of sleep and then I get them up and then my fiance Heidi wakes up with the kids and we start making lunch, or she started making lunch and I kissed them goodbye, told him have a great day school, and then I pretty much leave for work, and then once I get to work by the time she drops him off I'm like getting to my trucks around like seven forty seven forty five and we always made contact like right before I get in my truck and then go to work which they just went to the book fair and they bought three books it's like twenty five dollars and she couldn't wait to read to Silas whenever she whenever his house got home we just bought three brand-new books which is right here inside the house and that's the last time I actually made contact with her.    
    
Camerman/Reporter2: Shane so drop that phone down a little bit, try to talk `<unintelligible>`    
    
`<They talk over each other while readjusting SC>`    
    
SC: It doesn’t feel natural at all.    
    
Camerman/Reporter2: I know, I know, I’m sorry.    
    
SC: It’s like … doesn’t feel natural.    
    
Camerman/Reporter2: I know.    
    
SC: OK, um. Um. What was the next question?    
    
Reporter: Yeah, yeah, can you just talk a little bit more about when and where was the last time you saw Heidi?    
    
SC: Yeah it was actually like before I left this morning at 6:40. I left the house at 6:40. Um. Yeah. `<distracted by the light>` Yeah I like I left the house `<unintelligible, ?gonna look at the light?>` I lef the house at 6:40 and that's the last time I spoke to my uh son yeah I can't this is this is weird …    
    
Cameraman/Reporter2: I know, I know.    
    
SC: You’re moving my dad, you’re …    
    
`<talk over each other>`    
    
SC: Like I can't be professional, okay I'm I'm gonna call you back or something `<says to reporter on the phone>`.    
    
SC: I don't know what to do man you make me nervous `<walks off camera>`    
    
Cameraman/Reporter2: Do you want a different phone?    
    
SC: I don’t know. `<raises voice>` I just want to be natural, man, I just want to like, this is not, I don't know…    
    
`<Video stopped>`    
    
`<Video started. Shane now back in camera>`    
    
Cameraman/Reporter2: …try to look at the camera, where you want to look at …`<unintelligible>`    
    
SC: Yeah, man I’m sorry.    
    
Cameraman/Reporter2: No, you’re doing OK…. `<they talk over each other>`….    
    
`<Is this possibly his dad speaking?:>`…no pressure, no nothing, if it works it works, if it don’t it don’t. That’s just the way we gotta do it.    
    
SC: I just want to get the word out there I don't care how I look.    
    
`<talking over each other>`    
    
SC: OK    
    
Reporter: Yeah, so my other question was um is there anything important of Heidi’s that’s like missing right now, like is her cell phone there, um you know anything valuable missing…    
    
SC: There's nothing valuable missing, her purse and her wallet and everything was up here, her cell phone is missing it’s been turned off whenever I pulled up around 1:40 it's been off since then. So uh like the car seat, everything is upstairs, there's no signs of anything. There’s…    
    
Reporter: Alright, and um how like how long have you and Heidi been together, I mean as long as you’ve known her, has she ever disappeared before? Has she ever you know, just you know gone off the grid? Or anything like that?    
    
SC: No. No ma’am, she would never disappear, she is an amazing mom she would never we have a six-year-old son named Silas, beautiful kid she would never leave him. Nah… she would never do this. She just she wouldn't do this.    
    
Reporter: If you could confirm a couple of details though, how old is Margot?    
    
SC: Margo, uh she was born on the 26th of November, so three weeks, how? Yeah three weeks, about three weeks.    
    
Reporter: OK and um this is one of my last questions, but, you know, if you could say anything to Heidi right now, like if she was gonna watch the newscast, what would you want to tell her?    
    
SC: I want to tell her to uh please come home, you know your family's here, she wouldn’t do this. I'm not telling her this. I'm telling for the sake of the family, she has a beautiful kid, she has beautiful family, a beautiful dog named Zeus, she uh she would not do this by herself, she would she would not be doing this. This is definitely something that happened that was wrong, so anybody that could share, post, do anything, one second helps to save a beautiful family, beautiful kid, just anything you could do, just reach out. If you don't know me, I don't care, if you see the post, if you see this news, reach out keep your eyes open, just be open-minded. Anything suspicious, do anything you can to help. Please. This is a three week old baby out there, and a mom, and a son that’s missing her mom, and family.    
    
Reporter: And if you could say anything to the person that she and Margot might be with, what would you say to them?    
    
SC: Her and Margot might what? I’m sorry.    
    
Reporter: If you could say anything to, you know, the person that she might be with, like the person, cause you said she wouldn’t do this on her own. So if you could say something to the person who may be involved in the disappearance … `<unintelligible>`    
    
SC: If you’re involved, uh, I don't care, uh set her to the side, she’ll find her way home, just bring her home safe, or put her somewhere safe, her and the baby just feed the baby, only three weeks old. Just find a way you won't be in trouble, just drop her off, she has a beautiful family. Drop her off anywhere, I don't care, just make sure she's safe and okay, and the baby's okay. And then right away I don't know. I just want her home safe, doesn’t have to be here, just drop her off somewhere safe. If it is somebody, just please come home, or drop her off by my doorstep, I don’t care. Just bring my family home.    
    
Reporter: Alright Shane, well that was all of my questions. Um, if there is anything else you wanted to say or wanted to talk about? Anything that I missed?    
    
SC: No just I love you Heidi, I love you more … Just anybody that could support us in any way possible. I’m about to be off, so there's any support any old friends, share, post, like, anything, contacting anybody if you see her, just do whatever you can, we definitely appreciate it.    
    
Reporter: Well Shane, thank you for taking the time to speak with us. It’s been a very difficult interview. We greatly appreciate it. Um, and yeah, we’re going to get the story out and hopefully they’ll come home soon. So thank you again for the interview.

[FBI asking to search homes near missing mother, newborn apartment](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/fbi-asking-to-search-homes-near-missing-mother-newborn-apartment)    
FBI agents are searching homes near Heidi Broussard and Margot Carey's South Austin apartment. ...    
    
[…]    
    
TR lives two floors below Heidi and Margot. He tells us an agent asked for consent to enter his apartment and looked around. "They did their flashlight thing checked around checking in closets stuff like that—trying to make sure there was nothing hidden or strange and out of the ordinary," says TR.    
    
People living in homes behind the fence that backs up to the complex tell CBS Austin they, too have gotten knocks on the door. One woman says FBI agents asked to come in her backyard and looked near the fence line of her property.    
    
[…]    
    
In the meantime, community members are planning a search for Heidi and Margot this weekend. Organizer Sarra tells us people are on standby and prepared to help.    
    
However, Austin Police say at this time, a community-led search will likely not help them and they will request assistance if needed.

The case has garnered international coverage and attention. People following the case online created a [Reddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeidiBroussard/) and [over two dozen Facebook groups](https://www.facebook.com/search/groups/?q=heidi%20broussard&epa=SERP_TAB) to discuss the details of the investigation and speculate about what might have happened to Broussard and her daughter. ...    
    
[…]    
    
Around four to five FBI agents were at Broussard’s apartment complex on South First Street and William Cannon Drive on Wednesday, talking to residents and knocking on doors.    
    
MT, who moved into the apartment complex two weeks ago with her boyfriend, said the FBI visited her unit Wednesday afternoon, asking her if she knew anything about the situation and requested information about the make and model of her car.    
    
SA, who has lived in the complex for about a year, said FBI agents visited her apartment on Wednesday afternoon and also asked to search her home and her car. That was the fourth time they visited, she said.

SC: .. yeah…I don't care what’s …alright …

SC: Every day we uh I wake up first because I have to go to work first, and then I do a little morning routine, do everything, they start waking up around 6:30, and so like I start waking them up, give em kisses goodbye `<cries>` have a good day at school, and then she starts making their sandwiches and um so I went to work, she took Margo with Silas she dropped him off at school to the book fair and after the book fair she called me around 8:00 something on her way home from the Book Fair says she spent $25, I was like that's okay and I told her I have to go cuz I was on my way out, and I told her I love you, bye, and pretty much I worked all day till about 1:00 something and then I got here around 2:00, I seen her car, walked upstairs, she wasn't here, and her phone was off so I thought she was at a friend's house cuz the friend lives in the same complex so she might be over there with her phone off, so I thought nothing of it but she was not back yet so then I went and picked up my son from daycare, and brought him home, and he didn't finish his lunch so he told me to grill it for him. `<cries>` And uh. Basically then after a little bit I called my dad, he said don't worry about it too much right now, and I called her friends and she wasn't heard from them, her friends didn't hear from her, so then I called the cops, and then they came over here I think it was around 7:30. I think. And ever since then it's just been trying to reach out, just just help, I don't know. She’s a great mom, she needs to be back.    
    
Reporter: So the last time you heard from her was around 8:30?    
    
SC: Yeah yeah 8, 8, even probably before then like 8:15, I would say.    
    
Reporter: And you called the cops around 7, right?    
    
SC: Yeah 7ish, it was like 7:15 or 7:30 maybe something like that, yeah    
    
Reporter: Tell me a little bit about about Heidi and Margot.    
    
SC: Oh, they're amazing, they're um beautiful, loving, loves everybody she has the best group of friends. Margot `<cries>` is the sweetest she’s only 2, 3 weeks old and she's like the cutest little puckered lips.

Uh. I don't know, like the smallest little baby, she's only seven pounds and it's a teeny tiny lovable baby. Keeps you warm at night.    
    
Reporter: Margot’s not not your only child with Heidi, right?    
    
SC: No I have a six-year-old boy named Silas. He's amazing, plays sports `<cries>`, great baseball player, does karate, beautiful little kid as well, so fun very intelligent, loving, he’s just like his mom. He needs his mom back. `<cries>` He needs you back. Anybody, I don’t care if you think it's a look-alike, just    
call it in. And help. Please.    
    
Reporter: What have the past, I don’t even know what has it been, two days now? What has this been like for you, have you guys received a lot of calls? Have you…    
    
    
SC: Yes we received a lot, a lot of support of people I mean news stations, uh just random people on Facebook, old friends that I forgot about from like high school are like I'm hoping you're doing okay,  so we have a lot of support, and uh it's just people coming over here, and just sitting back and just wishing I could do more, and not knowing what to do is the hardest part cuz I don't know where she's at, I don't know if she's suffering, I don't know anything and I can't help I'm helpless, and that's the worst feeling in the world. Just to be helpless, and I know the cops and investigators are doing their job, they're doing a great job. I just want to do more, it feels like we could do more. And that's where everyone comes in. This is a group, so I'll do it together.    
    
Reporter: Can you just um talk about, you know, the way the car was left, the way that the home was left…    
    
SC: Uh, everything was like she was home, I mean, that's why I thought she was at her friend's house like she walked to the apartment complex. The car seat’s upstairs, her purse is upstairs, her ID, wallet, there's no signs of her taking the baby. She she would never leave her car door unlocked, her car door was unlocked, so that's that's a weird sign. So um I don't know anything about that. Her purse was inside her car with all the money still inside it, of it, her ID, her cards her full purse it's just the only thing gone is her, the baby, her keys, and her cell phone which has been off since I tried to call her at 1:40.    
    
Reporter: So her keys um is that her her car keys or …?    
    
SC: Car keys, apartment, mailbox, it's it’s it’s like a set of keys. Yeah.    
    
Reporter: `<unintelligible>`    
    
SC: Yes and she never leaves the car door locked but I mean she does have a 3 week old baby so I don't know. But she she would not leave the car unlocked. I’m I'm a big pusher on that so I push her to lock everything, so…    
    
Reporter: One of the things we first talked about when we first got here was obviously there’s a lot of scrutiny on you.    
    
SC: Mm huh    
    
Reporter: And I imagine that’s got to be tough when you’re going through this absolute nightmare    
    
SC: Yes    
    
Reporter: And then people obviously have to check you off the list, that’s that’s got to be really difficult.    
    
SC: Yeah, it’s I mean like I don’t even like I pretty much just ignored that. I I don't know how to handle it, but like I know it's a question. But `<chuckles>` I mean `<chuckles>` I don't I don't know a er like I don’t know how to, I just ignore it cuz I know it's just not true.    
    
Dad: It’s negative    
    
SC: Yeah it’s negative, so I don't wanna, yeah.    
    
Dad: We’re trying to be positive and and find her, you know, you know we can’t do help anything about what anybody thinks…    
    
SC: Yeah. I haven’t even seen any comments other than…    
    
Dad: … other than what we think…    
    
SC: Yeah    
    
Dad: …and that’s all that matters.    
    
Reporter: Can you talk about you know you’re trying to find her, talk about things you guys are doing because it seems that you’re doing a ton.    
    
SC: Yeah. I mean the first day we’re I was going through dumpsters over here, to see if `<unintelligible>` her keys, or just walking around the apartment complex. I sat outside to see any suspicions, anything that was weird, I seen anything, I asked like the next morning and I just sat out here for hours and just asked everybody if they seen or heard screaming, any anything that was off or suspicious, everyone's no but I mean like they're all saying no. And uh…    
    
Dad: Checked the cameras…    
    
SC: Yeah we uh we went across to the HEB, we asking everybody for if they had cameras on their car I don't know we're just asking all the questions that we can and looking through everything.    
That’s that's what I'm saying like there's only I don't know what else to do or this it's already the third day and it's getting scary. This is, it, I don't know    
    
Dad: Checked the traffic lights at both ends there's two uh uh intersections here and all they do is if you break a law or you run light and they film you so that wasn't viable, and then we checked all the HEBs we checked you know they they I guess they have it on all their stores combined and whatever and nothing came from that either, so we're still just trying uh we have a an agency coming tomorrow uh the guy’s name is Tim…    
    
SC: Tim Miller    
    
Dad: … Miller and he has an agency that helps folks. He had the same thing happened to him, as a result he's developed a company that has high-tech equipment to go in and do things very quickly and in some views more efficiently than the local police, so he's going to be here tomorrow and help us with a bunch of it and we're hopefully hopeful that he'll come up with something so. It's all state-of-the-art equipment.    
    
Reporter: How how do you deal with this with, I mean, you’ve still got kids at home, how…    
    
SC: Yes. I haven’t I haven’t told them but I just try to I mean like they're there with this other part of the family right now until we at least get any answer, so that's why I have great support, and their kind of juggling with them right now why all this is going on over here, so I don't want to put that in their brains yet cuz I'm I'm an adult and I cannot even handle it, so I'm not gonna put that in their heads until we know something `<cries>` they’re too young.    
    
Reporter: What uh what else do you want people to know?    
    
SC: That this is amazing family, I mean `<cries>` she's so supportive and she just wants to help everybody as well. She wants to help. I mean she's the most giving person, if she only has four dollars in the bank account and she’s still helping somebody out, you know. She's a great person, she wouldn't, she needs to be back, her son needs her, I need her, her family needs her. Just… anyone with a little baby that kind of looks like her, please give anybody a call. News, 911, I don't care.    
    
Dad: We’re open to anything    
    
SC: Anything, any help, any any help    
    
Dad: …uh get a hold of Austin PD, or we're soon to have a cell phone number that you can call and we'll keep everybody posted on that, or we can people can give tips there probably we're gonna try and get a reward going for the for information leading to finding her so that's in the near future.    
    
Reporter: Thank you so much is there anything else that I’m missing?    
    
SC: Just everybody be on board the more shares the more likes, comments, any platform that you could do, share. If you don't know me, I don't care just put it out there and just let it get around.

Transcript of Austin Police Department press conference Dec. 17, 2019:    
(Note: I don't know the identity of the reporters who asked questions, or whether some reporters asked more than one question. I simply labelled them sequentially.) ^uf6em  
    
  
Det. Herries: Good afternoon. My name is Brad Herries. B-R-A-D H-E-R-R-I-E-S. I'm a detective with the Austin Police Department Violent Crimes Unit. Today I want to provide a update on the current state of our search for Heidi Broussard and Margot Carey. I'll reiterate their, their descriptions. Heidi is a 33 year old white female. She stands 5 foot 3, 150 pounds. She has dark hair with highlights in it, and Margot is now a 3 week old child. Her last doctor's appointment she was 7 pounds 7 ounces and 22 inches long. Heidi and Margot were last seen on Thursday, December 12th here in Austin Texas. It's believed that Heidi and Margot's last known location was at their apartment complex in the area of William Cannon and South First, and we believe them to be there sometime the morning of that Thursday December 12th. Heidi and Margot were reported missing to us the Austin Police Department at approximately 7:30 that night on Thursday. Patrol went to the scene, conducted an initial investigation, and contacted detectives with the Austin Police Department. Since that moment we've been working this case continually. We have asked for the help of the FBI. The FBI is sending in the CARD team, that's the child abduction response deployment team here to Austin to assist with this investigation and with this search for Heidi and for Margot. Throughout this investigation we've had the assistance of a number of units both locally, statewide, and nationally, including Austin Police Department missing persons unit, the Austin Police Department Special Investigations Unit, the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Texas Rangers, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Travis County Search and Rescue team, as well as the Texas Parks and Wildlife. Those units have continued to support us and continue to support us as we move on with this investigation in our search for Heidi and Margot. I want to thank the community for tips that we've received in this case. We’ve received numerous tips from all different mediums and all different sources. We ask that those tips that are made be reported to the Austin Police Department. We've seen a lot of tips that are posted online and with those tips, we may not find them we're aware of a lot of a lot of Facebook pages a lot of online channels where people are posting comments that may be relevant to our investigation. We ask that you also share those with the Austin Police Department. Our resources, we’re we're doing our best to keep up with the number of posts, the number of tips that are being posted online but we ask that you contact us the Austin Police Department at area code 512-974-5250 with any tips. If you see Heidi or Margot please contact the Austin Police Department or your local law enforcement agency if you see them out and about. We continue to search, we've been working continually since Thursday night to try and find Heidi and Margot.    
    
Reporter1: Detective, can we ask some questions here, given where you are right now with the investigation is Shane Carey a person of interest?    
    
Det. Herries: So we have an ongoing current investigation and I'm not ready to get into anyone that we have as a person of interest, to be perfectly honest with you, this case is unique in that we don't have a person of interest right now. We're exploring every avenue that we have and every possibility, and to be perfectly honest, anything is possible at this point. We're working down every angle to try and exclude possibilities and narrow that down to locate Margot and Heidi, and that's why we need the public's help, and if you see Margot or Heidi or have any information about their whereabouts please contact the Austin Police Department.    
    
Reporter2: …`<unintelligible>` … that Heidi left on her own?    
    
Det. Herries: It's possible that the Heidi and Margot have left on their own accord. It's also possible that there may be something nefarious or foul play involved, and to be honest, we don't know the answer to that question, and that's what we're continuing to work on as we speak right now.    
    
Reporter3: The possiblity that Heidi could have left on her own is why the child abduction response `<unintelligible>`    
    
Det. Herries: The introduction of the FBI to the investigation is to help us, and the acronyms and and titles that they use for specialized units are not an implication of the direction or, or thoughts of this investigation. We're asking for any help that we can get and the FBI is being very gracious and helping us out with with that specialized unit.    
    
Reporter4: You named several agencies that are helping you with the search effort, but there hasn’t been visible boots on the ground that we’ve been able to see. Is there a certain area that you guys are looking into? Is there not an area? I guess, where are those boots on the ground efforts to find her happening?    
    
Det. Herries: So ever since Thursday night there have been officers on scene at their last known locations, at areas that would make sense for them to have been out doing video canvasses, knocking on doors, talking to neighbors, and doing anything we can do to try and find the current state, current position, or current location of Heidi and Margot.    
    
Reporter5: Can you tell us what `<unintelligible>` when she got back to her apartment where she was last seen?    
    
Det. Herries: So it was released earlier on she was dropping a child off at a school here in Austin and then returns to the apartment and that's where our our investigation begins is at the time she returned to the apartment.    
    
Reporter6: It's been it's been five days now, are you any closer to finding out what happened to her or finding the location? And what if anything have you been able to do to push the needle forward, have you recovered any new video that may be out there?    
    
Det. Herries: So we haven't released and to be honest with you it's an ongoing investigation we will not release all the information on what we're doing right now but I can assure you that continual investigations whether that be video canvass, speaking to neighbors, family, friends, co-workers, past co-workers, anything along those lines as well as forensic searches of their digital footprint and any electronic devices are all being continually evaluated and investigated by us.    
    
Reporter7: What can you share about any previous calls or disturbances at Heidi's apartment?    
    
Det. Herries: So the previous calls investigations those are something I would defer, but those are part of the ongoing investigations.    
    
Reporter8: You say that there you're still searching for her, you still assume that she is alive at this point like but the baby as well?    
    
Det. Herries: At this time we have no reason to believe that Marty, that Margot nor Heidi are harmed. We are still looking for them in a in a search and recovery manner with them being alive. Our assumption is that they're alive and the sooner that we can find them, the better, that's why again we asked for the community's assistance, for the public's assistance, and if you see either of them, or have any information related to Margot or Heidi and their whereabouts or the circumstances surrounding their past five days, we ask that you contact the Austin Police Department.    
    
Reporter9: Can you please confirm whether there have, or have not, actually been any domestic instances, incidents reported at that address?    
    
Det. Herries: I’d uh I can't go into the details of that, that's part of the ongoing investigation.    
    
Reporter10: Are you reaching out to or trying to work with any out of state law enforcement agencies `<unintelligible>` across state lines `<unintelligible>` looking into that she possibly went back home to Louisiana in the middle of this?    
    
Det. Herries: So our partners with the Department of Public Safety are helping out associating, helping out reach out to those other states and those other law enforcement agencies to conduct those investigations that are, frankly, outside of our jurisdiction, and we are continuing to work on those angles.    
    
Reporter11: There are a lot of questions about why there was not an Amber Alert issued when she went missing and when Margot went missing asked on our website.    
    
Det. Herries: So an Amber Alert carries with it a very specific set of circumstances and the circumstances surrounding this offense, this this call for service, don't don't match that Amber Alert. I'll defer you to DPS for their their criteria specifically for the Amber Alert. I can tell you that it didn't match that.    
    
Reporter12: Detective, you mentioned the fact that you had moved up the time now from 7:50 in the morning at the school to some time in the morning that the mother and child were seen at their apartment complex. Was that due to surveillance video that was on scene then?    
    
Det. Herries: So that's just part of our ongoing investigation. We have reason to believe that both of them were back at the apartment complex after being at the school.    
    
Reporter13: There had been some suggestion that her keys and her purse were found either in her car or in the apartment. Where were her items of personal property found?    
    
Det. Herries: So that's part of the scene that we're processing and continuing the process as we speak and those questions I'm gonna, I’m gonna say are part of the ongoing investigation…    
    
Reporter14: Have you been able to nail down about where Shane was on Thursday throughout the day, and at what point he got home, and all of that?    
    
Det. Herries: The timeline of all people surrounding Heidi and Margot, whether it be family members and friends, are things that that we've been investigating and speaking to them about, and that's part of the ongoing investigation into this case.    
    
APD Spokesperson: Thank you.

We’re at the apartment complex where missing mom Heidi Broussard and her newborn baby Margot Carey live. Stark difference from previous days where APD and FBI have talked to neighbors. Today, with the exception of a couple of APD cruisers passing through, it has been empty.

[NW Harris Co. home swarmed by FBI and Austin police](https://abc13.com/nw-harris-co-home-swarmed-by-fbi-and-austin-police/5770521/)    
About a dozen officers from the **Texas Rangers, Department of Public Safety, FBI and the Austin Police Department** have been at a home in northwest Harris County for hours Thursday.    
    
It appears to be part of a high profile investigation on Bo Jack Drive near Jersey Village.    
    
An Eyewitness News crew waited for what was believed to be a warrant service. Then, around 8:15 p.m., there was movement, with law enforcement going into the house. ^csgfx  
    
[…]    
    
SkyEye 13 was overhead earlier in the day, and a Nissan was seen parked up close to the house.    
    
[…]    
The presence of Austin police has prompted our questions on whether this is connected to the disappearance of Austin mother Heidi Broussard and her infant daughter. They haven't been seen since Dec. 12.    
    
A neighbor told ABC13 police asked her Thursday night whether she remembers any movement here on that day.

[Expert calls circumstances in missing Austin mother, baby case "profoundly rare"](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/expert-calls-circumstances-in-missing-austin-mother-baby-case-profoundly-rare)    
[…]    
    
Assistant Professor at University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Michelle Jeanis has a research focus on missing persons cases.    
    
[…]    
    
Jeanis says statistically speaking, it's extremely uncommon for people to just get up and walk away, especially with a small child.    
    
The possibility of an abduction, she claims, is even more unlikely. "It's profoundly rare that strangers abduct an adult or strangers abduct a child and the two of them together would not typically make an easy victim," says Jeanis.    
    
[…]    
    
In missing persons cases, Jeanis claims the more media attention the better. However, that does not mean investigators reveal everything. "I'm thinking that law enforcement has evidence that they're not for safety reasons sharing with us," says Jeanis.

Numerous law enforcement officials surrounded a home in Houston on Thursday, in connection with missing Austin mom Heidi Broussard and her infant daughter, Margo.    
    
ABC 13 reports that authorities conducted a “[high profile investigation](https://abc13.com/nw-harris-co-home-swarmed-by-fbi-and-austin-police/5770521/)” at a home off of Bo Jack Drive in NW Harris County. Investigators secured the area with crime scene tape and were specifically concentrating on a Nissan parked in the driveway. The car reportedly belongs to someone that Heidi knows.    
    
At around 8:15 p.m., authorities entered the residence.    
    
Officials removed a body from the home after a medical examiner’s van arrived on Thursday night. So far, the identity is unknown.    
    
A female infant was taken from the home after a Child Protective Services call to the local fire department. According to authorities, the baby was alive with no visible signs of injury.

Law enforcement officials said at least one person is behind bars in connection with the death of Heidi Broussard, a mother who vanished from Austin with her 3-week-old baby on December 12.    
    
The suspect reportedly said she, too, was pregnant while Heidi was pregnant with her infant daughter, Margo. The woman reportedly carried out the scheme for nine months and had been plotting to take Heidi’s baby away from her.    
    
Authorities found Margo alive inside a Houston home on Thursday night. She was taken to a local hospital for a medical evaluation. Heidi was found deceased at the location.    
    
A car found at the home is registered to Magen Rose Fieramusca. She is currently in custody at the Harris County Jail facing kidnapping and tampering charges. Her bond has been set at $60,000 for now, but upgraded charges are expected. ^2etcw  
    
Meanwhile, authorities also confirmed that they have no reason to believe that Heidi’s fiance, Shane Carey, had anything to do with her abduction or death.

Heidi Broussard coverage: Just spoke with a Houston lawyer who represented Magen Fieramusca in a theft case that was resolved in November with a dismissal when prosecutors couldn't prove case. Fieramusca is a suspect in the disappearance & death of Broussard, her friend. Thread.    
[Ryan Autullo on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AutulloAAS/status/1208086916316434433)    
    
The lawyer, Eric Devlin, said Fieramusca was fired from a cash express store in Humble after she was charged with stealing $5k. Manager said he saw her on video putting the money in her purse. Prosecutors believe she did it, but couldn't prove beyond reasonable doubt & dismissed.    
[Ryan Autullo on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AutulloAAS/status/1208088117065998337)    
    
Devlin, theattorney, said Fieramusca "looked pregnant" at a recent court appearance. He had no personal relationship with her but did not detect any serious mental health issues. "She talked to me fine." Fieramusca was out on bond for the entire case after Aug 2018 arrest.

Caressa Potter, longtime friend of both Broussard and Fieramusca, told KXAN reporter Steffi Lee that she had been in contact with Fieramusca every day since Broussard has been missing. Potter said they talked multiple times a day, and during those calls, Potter said she could hear a baby in the background. ^wvqxe  
    
Potter said Fieramusca told her friends and family she also recently gave birth to a baby named Luna Mae, but wouldn’t show any pictures of her. ^gkg8e

Potter said Fieramusca used to go by the name Maygen Humphrey, but doesn’t know when she changed her name. She said the three met each other at church camp when they were pre-teens. Potter described Broussard and Fieramusca as “best friends.” ^wv3kz

Transcript of Austin Police Department press conference 12/20/2019 (after suspect arrest) ^8-98t  
    
**Chief Brian Manley:** Good afternoon. Thank you all for coming out for an update on the investigation into the missing mother and child from here in Austin. I appreciate your patience in waiting for this briefing today. I want to introduce a few of the folks that are here with me that will be speaking at this press conference today. Special agent in charge of the FBI Christopher Combs, I have Margaret Moore the Travis County district attorney, with us representing DPS is Todd Snyder who is the Regional Director, and then Austin Police Department detective Brad Herries.    
I want to identify at the beginning of this press conference that we will go against our standard practice of taking questions at the end of this press conference because this is still a very active and ongoing investigation we have multiple teams as investigators that are different jurisdictions as we speak in this room today that are still investigating this case. So we are going to give you all of the information that we can share at this point. We understand there is a tremendous amount of interest in this case. But we're going to give you all the information that we can, and we commit to you that we will give you updates as we can without impacting the integrity of this investigation. It is heartbreaking circumstances that bring us here today as you all are well aware that there has been a lot that has developed in the overnight hours. This all began back on December 12th when 33 year old Heidi Broussard and infant daughter two week old baby Margot Casey[sic] were last seen as they dropped off their sibling and their son at school and we have been investigating their disappearance since that time. On Tuesday APD detective Herries gave a very thorough briefing to the media on what had been developed at that point through the investigation, and there's a lot that has happened since that time, most notably the events that took place out in the Houston and Harris County area overnight and into the early morning hours today.    
    
Detective Herries will give you a briefing here momentarily updating the specifics of what took place. But what we will confirm at this point is that we did recover an infant female child that we do believe at this time is Margot, however we are awaiting the results of DNA testing to confirm that identity, and that testing may take us between 48 and 72 hours to get that confirmation. Additionally we recovered the body of an adult female. We do believe that this is Ms. Broussard, however again we are awaiting the results of the autopsy to confirm her identity.    
    
We do have one person that has been arrested and charged. The charges that have been filed at this point are two charges of kidnapping and one charge of tampering with a corpse. We are not confirming the identity of the suspect at this time. I do understand that there are pictures being circulated and names being circulated in the media, however we're not going to confirm again to protect the integrity of this ongoing investigation. There may be additional charges that are filed in this case as the investigation carries on and that will be determined as we develop more information and uncover more evidence.    
    
    
This was a tremendous undertaking by the many different divisions that I will recognize before detective Herries comes up and gives a briefing several units from the Office of Police Department participated in this investigation to include our homicide division, our missing persons division, our Special Investigations Unit, and our Robbery Unit, our Violent Crimes Task Force, our organized crime division, the Texas DPS Rangers were involved, the Travis County District Attorney's Office, the FBI, the FBI's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment team, their CARD squad was here, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Travis County search and rescue, and Child Protective Services all pulled together to work on this case. Again everyone hoping for an outcome different than the one that appears    
    
    
that we had and that is with the loss of life, and although we are grateful that it appears as though we have safely recovered baby Margot again we do believe that that Ms. Broussard lost her lives in this incident. Detective Herries will now come up and give you a briefing on the events that have taken place in this investigation over the past 24 hours.    
  
**Det. Brad Herries:** Good afternoon my name is Brad Herries. I'm a detective with the Austin Police Department cold case homicide and missing persons unit. I'm going to go through a brief timeline of the events that have happened in the past seven or eight days. This is this is not all-inclusive. On Thursday December 12th, 2019 Heidi Broussard, a 33 year old white female, and her two-week-old baby Margot were last seen dropping off Heidi's six-year-old child at his school at Cowan Elementary. Heidi and Margot are believed to have returned to their residence in the area of William Cannon and South First at approximately 7:30 in the morning on December 12th. The complainant arrived home and found that Heidi, his girlfriend, and Margot, his daughter, were not home. As the day progressed, the complainant went to pick up their six-year-old child from after school activities and found that Margot was not there. The complaint became alarmed and contacted the Austin Police Department along with friends and family trying to find the location of his girlfriend and daughter. The Austin Police Department was contacted at approximately 9:00, I'm sorry, 7:31 p.m. on December 12th. Officers on scene began an investigation. They searched for them both there in the complex, conducted preliminary investigations, and contacted me that evening on December 12th, 2019. At that time a BOLO was issued that's a "be on the lookout" within our department. Both were entered into national and statewide databases as missing, and their information was dispersed throughout the community using a reverse 911 system that reached over 4,000 people in that area. Their images and descriptions were released to the media later in the morning of December 12th, excuse me, of December 13th, 2019. We utilized various resources and legal processes in the attempt to locate Heidi and Margot. This has been an ongoing process with numerous warrants that have been been approved and executed in the search for them. We have spoken with family, with friends, with co-workers, with neighbors, we have canvassed the areas that we know them to have been in, and we have done video canvasses of any areas that we have believed them to have been in. We conducted video surveillance in association with some of our federal and state wide partners, we have done extensive video collection, online and social media research, interviews, phone calls, and these investigations have gone across Texas and gone across out of state lines. NCMEC, one of our partners, released a nationwide flyer with images depicting Margo and Heidi. As we progress through this investigation local, state, and federal partners followed tips and leads that were provided by the public. We received numerous calls to our tip lines, notifications online, various tips of people who thought they had seen Heidi or Margo, had information related to their location, and those tips were vetted and explored and investigated fully. As the week progressed, this current week, a lead was generated that created a location of interest in the Houston area, in Harris County. Federal, state, and local resources deployed to that area of Harris County and began to investigate a resident there. Ultimately those investigators encountered an individual outside of that resident who was detained on Thursday December 19th, 2019. As the evening progressed a search warrant was issued for property on at that residence, both vehicles and the residence. Those search warrants were signed and were carried out by the Austin Police Department, Department of Public Safety, and with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation as we conducted those searches. During that search we located a baby who is currently safe, currently healthy, currently in the care of Child Protective Services. That child's visual appearance is consistent with that of baby Margot. As the search continued, officers located a deceased adult female on the property. And as Chief Manley said earlier, early indications would lead us to believe that that is Heidi. The property in Houston continues to be an active scene, we are investigating multiple locations between Austin and Houston and in the surrounding areas. With the assistance of the FBI, state-level partners with    
    
    
DPS, the Texas Rangers, and the Harris County Sheriff's Office. The Harris County Medical Examiner's Office is conducting an autopsy today of the deceased adult female to determine the cause of death, determine the manner of death, and as those as that information is released to us investigators we will continue our investigation of this event. As Chief Manley said, an arrest has been made in this case. The charges are two counts of kidnapping one count of tampering with the corpse. The total bond for the three charges is six hundred thousand dollars. That person is is in custody as we speak. As I said, this is an ongoing and active investigation. If you if you have any information related to the disappearance of Heidi Broussard and her two week now three week old daughter Margot, we ask that you contact the Austin Police Department at 512-974-5250. Yes, last name H-E-R-R-I-E-S first name Brad B-R-A-D and I'm a detective.    
    
**Christopher Combs:** Good afternoon everyone. My name is Christopher Combs, I'm the FBI Special Agent in Charge. It's been a horrible week here in Austin and we had all prayed that we would be able to find Heidi alive. Unfortunately as the chief expressed, we don't believe that's the case. We are very thankful, though, that through the combined efforts here we were able to recover baby Margot, and the baby seems to be in very good health. I know everybody asks how do we do these things, how are we able to do that, some of that we can't discuss openly right now because it's ongoing. But I just wanted to stress that these recoveries happen because of dogged police work where the Austin Police Department, their missing persons unit, has done an incredible job in combination with the Texas Rangers, and with the assets that the FBI was able to bring to bear. It really is through that partnership of those agencies with a lot of other help, from a lot of other agencies that we were able to recover that baby which really is one of the greatest things I think we could do is to save a child. One of the things we brought to bear in this particular case is something called the FBI's child abduction rapid deployment team. These are national teams that the FBI has around the country that we deploy at the request of our state and local partners whenever a child is abducted. We were able to bring that team here to Austin and work next to the detectives and the Rangers to bring this case to closure. And to recover that child. The CARD teams were developed back in 2006 and through this investigation they've deployed 167 times. What that team really brings to bear is is that expertise of being through so many of these abductions, knowing how they work ...

**Travis County DA Margaret Moore:** ...Margaret Moore M-O-O-R-E. Like Special Agent in Charge Combs, I wish we had completely good news today but I am proud of the efforts that have taken place here I think you think it's a demonstration of the dedication of law enforcement, the DA's office, that we spend, once the call came in we were working on it 24/7. I want to commend the dedicated lawyers in my office, two of them are standing here with me today. We established a major major crimes hotline when I took office and these attorneys take on this responsibility in addition to their regular duties so they are on call 24/7 and we got this call, they've been working and day in and day out with law enforcement to assist in getting the papers that were needed to conduct the searches and their pieces the investigation we will continue to be involved in this investigation of course as we evaluate what if any additional charges need to be brought. I always am feel very privileged to work with these dedicated individuals and I'm also pleased to be able to tell the citizens of this county how collaborative and thorough law enforcement is as we work on these major cases. I also would like to thank the Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg her office extended us every courtesy and assistance that we needed down there so expect that to continue.

I appreciate you respecting that we cannot take questions because we've given you everything we can at this point. and we are committed to providing you with additional information at which time we can, when it will not impact the further and ongoing investigations.

Baby Margot was found alive and well **in a swing** inside the home. An ambulance took the baby to the hospital. According to Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department, she didn't have any obvious injuries, but Child Protective Services called in requesting an evaluation.

He says Broussard and the baby were gone when he got home to their apartment around 2pm; shortly after that, he got a call from their son's school that he'd never been picked up. He called the cops after he says he got home from getting his son and found that Broussard and Margot still hadn't returned. ^glaw2

**TIMELINE    
    
Thursday, Dec. 12:** Broussard and Carey were [reported missing](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/austin-police-search-missing-mom-baby/269-e246b008-1502-4912-afe8-19c8285e16ad) by the [Austin Police Department](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/police). APD said they were last seen dropping off a child at [Cowan Elementary School](http://www.cowancoyotes.org/) that morning at around 7:30 a.m.    
    
Police obtained surveillance video which showed Broussard at the school.    
    
**Friday, Dec. 13:** Broussard's fiancé, Shane Carey, spoke to KVUE via phone, pleading for the public's help in finding Broussard and the baby.    
    
"I don't know why anybody would ever harm or touch these two beautiful women together," Shane Carey said over the phone.    
    
That evening, an Austin police chopper hovered over the apartment complex where they lived in South Austin, near the intersection of William Cannon Drive and South First Street.    
    
**Sunday, Dec. 15:** In an [interview with Good Morning America](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=815179345577779), Broussard's fiance said he's been with Broussard for nearly a decade and that they have two kids together, as well as a third child from his previous marriage.    
    
"I just don't see why no one heard any screams or anything out here. So we're trying to put the puzzle pieces together," Shane Carey said.    
    
Shane Carey said Broussard's family traveled to Austin from Louisiana for the search.    
    
"I just want her to come home," he said. "She's amazing. She's missed. She has her whole family here supporting, praying for her to come home, and hopefully that's just – I don't know – somebody to bring her home safe. I don't care, just drop her off."    
    
**Tuesday, Dec. 17:** Austin police hold their [first press conference](https://www.facebook.com/KVUEinsider/videos/613277806142820/?__xts__[0]=68.ARBCr4hPO94WUZxZb-MnItGLTDgUJl75c0CRzSTxpKpQ2k5fFZduS9TOsMo5QhEBKPe9qTg9TbCsoIIkt2QJMQodwt9tyJ46meDt9BVtwi_HRiyjdK21V22UiUy8g7onNfGZdccFh7i5LIxh3sh4yKR8BUQpN1kYz0rzwPfFvKNwo-fYUbRaIXiKXWXboaGoWw7dHJt5VPIzHkrmeC9FPjpsYA-jy1p2dhbg9oO9ddKfBLgnYlt3YkgA68_8UGcQwUJDRICMByEJ9Mq1ty9xgJYBBJyxzvMiuqCg4H9jeL-i2rJU5DptDuRQycam2NlxVflViPtFWELXfEh_OPHG0asW&__tn__=-R) about the case and reveal that the [FBI and Texas Rangers](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/austin-missing-mom-baby-fbi-texas-rangers-join/269-b320f417-75ea-42d6-b7a4-69cd2a13a16e) joined the case to search for Broussard and Margot Carey.    
    
[When APD was asked](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/austin-police-search-missing-mom-baby/269-e246b008-1502-4912-afe8-19c8285e16ad) if they believed the two were still alive, they said at that time they had no reason to believe that Margot nor Broussard was harmed.    
    
APD also addressed that the case did not meet the criterion for an [AMBER Alert to be issued.](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/austin-missing-mom-daughter-no-amber-alert/269-72a94d61-d439-441e-b595-6fab5cddb1d4)    
    
That night, Broussard's parents [spoke with KVUE in an emotional interview](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/austin-missing-mother-parents-beg-safe-return/269-3befce71-0fc8-4889-8bc0-4f31c55f0dfc), pleading for help finding the two.    
    
“We've just been hoping and praying that they find some clues to my daughter's disappearance,” David Broussard told KVUE on Dec. 17. “I've just been going out in the surrounding area and looking, hoping and just doing a little detective work.”    
    
**Friday, Dec. 20:** [Broussard's body was found at a Harris County home](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/heidi-broussard-houston-home-missing-austin-woman/269-f2ddad6d-7f7f-4b70-a304-d41f0cfcbdbb), along with a baby who was alive, according to reports.    
    
[The Harris County Medical Examiner's Office](https://ifs.harriscountytx.gov/Pages/default.aspx) said that they found a body in the trunk of a vehicle in Houston.    
    
KVUE confirmed that a Houston woman, who was a "close friend" to Broussard, was charged in connection to her death. She had been plotting to take Broussard's baby.    
    
Officials identified that woman to KVUE as Magen Fieramusca, 33.    
    
Fieramusca pretended to be pregnant at the same time as Broussard, law enforcement sources said.    
    
She is expected to be charged with murder, according to [KVUE's sister station KHOU](https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/investigation-at-nw-harris-county-home-tied-to-search-for-missing-austin-mother-her-infant-daughter/285-9d1ac684-fbd6-41c8-9627-30056ae7a863), and will be arraigned in Harris County.    
    
Officials do not believe that Shane Carey was involved in this plot.

Tammy Broussard, Heidi Broussard's mother, said early on Friday that police told her a body found in Jersey Village, Texas, is likely that of her daughter, who has been missing for a week.    
    
She added that police said that the medical examiner still needed to officially confirm the identity of the body found in a car trunk. Granddaughter Margot Carey was found in a home in good condition, police told her.    
    
Police have not publicly confirmed the details Broussard said she was told. They would not comment overnight.    
    
Craig Cummings with the Texas Department of Public Safety earlier told [NBC affiliate KPRC of Houston](https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2019/12/20/search-for-missing-austin-mom-newborn-leads-to-jersey-village-home/) that investigators were at a home in Jersey Village, which is northwest of Houston, in connection with the missing mother and her infant. A close friend of Broussard's lives at the home,  other friends told NBC News.

CF, whose sister is friends with the suspect, tells PEOPLE that Fieramusca called his sister, who could hear a baby calling in the background. Now, it is suspected that the baby was Margot.    
    
Fieramusca allegedly masterminded the abductions of Broussard, 33, and her baby girl, who is just weeks old.    
    
“She was supposedly Heidi’s friend for a long time,” says a family member of Broussard’s. “We’ve been knowing her for a long time.”

[…]    
    
Law enforcement sources believe Fieramusca began plotting to steal Broussard’s infant daughter before she was even born. They say the suspect went to prenatal doctor’s appointments with the victim and pretended to be pregnant at the same time. The suspect was even there for Margot’s birth on November 26.    
    
[…]    
    
It was CG who bailed Fieramusca out of jail in 2018 after her arrest on a theft charge. She was accused of stealing money from an Ace Express check cashing business where she was assistant manager.    
    
Her court-appointed attorney Eric Devlin says the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.    
    
Devlin met with his client several times and said she didn’t appear to be pregnant in the beginning.    
    
“When I first met her, she was not pregnant. Clearly did not appear to be pregnant at all,” Devlin said. “At the last setting, she appeared to be very pregnant.”    
    
[…]    
    
As far as her mental health, Devlin says nothing ever raised a red flag.    
    
“That is something that we are required to look at. If we have a concern about her mental health, we will have psych, have them evaluated in some way,” Devlin explained. “I had no concerns whatsoever when I interacted with her.”    
    
Their last meeting happened in November, not long before Margot was born.    
    
[…]    
    
Broussard referred to Fieramusca as “her bestie.”

Margot was found unharmed in the Houston home and taken to a local hospital. She’s now in foster care while police and CPS investigate. A spokesperson for CPS said this is standard procedure.    
    
CPS must now determine where Margot should be permanently placed. First, a [CPS caseworker](https://www.khou.com/article/news/investigations/child-protective-services-caseworker-day-in-the-life/285-e0749af9-3c6e-400d-b6ee-af298a8eb453) must confirm that people claiming to be related to Margot in fact are.

Friends say Magen Fieramusca was calling people, even saying she'd be willing to do interviews to help find the missing mother from Austin, Heidi Broussard. ^igwm6  
    
Now, law enforcement sources in Austin say she was pretending to be pregnant in a plot to steal her best friend's baby.    
    
[…]    
    
He's stepped up to help on hundreds of cases, and when Miller got a list of Broussard's friends, Fieramusca was his first call. ^t95n-  
    
"She said, 'Mr. Miller thank you for what you're doing.' She says, 'I'm going to keep talking to people and everything and if I come up with anything, is it OK if I call you?'" ^qlwe4  
    
Miller says Fieramusca told him the last time she talked to Broussard was the morning she went missing.    
    
[…]    
    
"Well, she (Heidi) was having problems breastfeeding, I (Miller) said nothing else? No, that was it. She was in a good mood just having problems breastfeeding," said Miller.    
    
[…]    
    
"She was super friendly – and so bubbly," said RW, who met Heidi waiting tables at Cracker Barrel. "The last time I saw Heidi was a week before she went missing, that's when I met Margot, her daughter, for the first time."    
    
Then days after Broussard went missing, RW talked to Fieramusca and heard a baby in the background. A baby she thought was Fieramusca's at the time, not knowing it was all part of what investigators now say was a plan.

[…]    
    
Austin police confirmed Friday **they arrested a person in connection to Broussard’s case on the same charges as Fieramusca.** However, authorities would not confirm the person’s identity, citing a need to protect the integrity of the investigation.    
    
Seven days after Broussard and her 3-week-old baby, Margot Carey, were reported missing, authorities said they found Broussard’s body stuffed into the trunk of **a different car** parked outside of a home in a Northwest Houston suburb.    
    
Broussard was strangled to death with an undisclosed implement, according to the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. Officials have ruled her death a homicide.    
    
[…]    
    
Law enforcement officials told the American-Statesman they suspect Fieramusca pretended to be pregnant during Broussard’s pregnancy and plotted to kidnap Margot even before she was born.

Surveillance footage obtained from slain mother Heidi Broussard’s Austin apartment complex showed her [willingly getting into a car](https://abc13.com/friend-of-mom-found-dead-taken-to-austin-to-face-charge/5771862/) on December 12 with a woman she had been friends with for years, sources told ABC 13. Heidi was later held against her will, authorities alleged, along with her 3-week-old baby.    
    
[…]    
    
The Cy-Fair Fire Department found an infant alive inside the same Houston home on Thursday, believed to be Heidi’s baby girl, Margo. Law enforcement officials said Fieramusca had the baby in an infant swing inside the home and insisted that the child belonged to her.    
    
[…]    
    
While Heidi was missing, Fieramusca allegedly made calls and volunteered to help find her. Tim Miller, founder of the search and rescue group, Texas Equusearch, said Fieramusca indicated she was at the hospital when Heidi gave birth to Margo.    
    
[…]    
    
Previous reports indicated that a second suspect had been detained, but **authorities have not confirmed or denied whether the person was questioned and released or arrested.**

Speaking outside her Houston home, his mother CG2, 54, said her son had been renting the property to Humphrey for two years.

Asked if her son had been in a relationship with Fieramusca, who also went by Humphrey, she said: 'No, she lived there. That was it. She never paid the rent. She was there for two years and never paid a thing.'    
    
However, CG bailed out Fieramusca out of jail in 2018 after she was arrested for theft for allegedly stealing money from an Ace Express check cashing business where she worked as assistant manager. The case was dismissed for lack of evidence.

Transcript of Tim Miller interview: ^a3dsz  
  
Tim Miller: The family called us first and then I called and talked to the detectives up in Austin and we talked several times with detectives, and they said we just don't have anything yet on the investigation, it's narrowing this thing down to an area that we think we need to search. And he asked me, said have you found any areas? And I said, well, I did but I don't know if they make any sense. I said, I rode around with Shane for a long time. I you know I spent a good part of the day with him and you know we hate to go up there and spend a lot of money and burn up a bunch of resources with just shooting a arrow in the sky wherever it comes down, that's where we start. So we stayed in close touch, I talked to Shane almost every day. Shane's frustrated at best...    
    
Reporter: He took a lot of heat.    
    
Tim Miller: He took a lot of heat, and Shane would call me and say man they brought me and they polygraphed me, they kept me seven and a half hours and stuff, and he got upset with them, he called them some names that we can't say, and he said if I had anything do with this, squeeze it out of me. How come they can't squeeze it out of me? And you know, and Shane was questionable in my mind. He was. And his stories weren't just quite as consistent as I thought, but I got to remember, I went through that my own self, and in a very beginning, there's a lot of different things going through your head, so I understand it. Now. Now I understand. But then you know another friend gave me some friends of Heidi's and says why don't you call them, so my first call was to Magen. And she answered the phone, and I told her who I was, and she said yeah I've seen you on TV so many times and just thank you for helping find my friend, and I said well Magen, I said what's your heart telling you on this. And she's like, Shane did it. She says I was there 10 years ago when they met, I told Heidi stay away from this guy, he's trouble relationships on and off, there's been a lot of abuse going on, Shane keeps saying well that baby's not even mine and stuff, she called me back in May and said that her and Shane had a terrible fight, and and and she just went on and on and on and to the point that literally 45 minutes later, I said Magen, listen, I got it I got to go I'm getting a call on the other line. And said Mr. Miller thank you for what you're doing, she says I'm going to keep talking to people and everything if I come up with anything, is it okay if I call you? And I said Magen please do. Please call me. And I mean looking back at that conversation on Sunday to now, there was not one single indication that I would ever believe she had anything to do with it. So you know and she's at the hospital with Heidi when she has the baby, here she is after Heidi gets out at the house helping and everything, and supposedly the best friend. So    
    
Reporter: Not just friend, best friend.    
    
Tim Miller: They were best friends, yeah. She had like three really really close friends and and Magen was right there.    
    
Reporter: When the baby was born.    
    
Tim Miller: When the baby was born.    
    
Reporter: We heard she went to baby appointments ...    
    
Tim Miller: Oh yes. She did everything. Best friend.    
    
Reporter: Have you seen these baby registries in her name?    
    
Tim Miller: Uh well some people told me about some things out there, and you know, and and me of course there's rumors going around that Magen's boyfriend was wanting to break up with her, so she told him and she was pregnant, and you know, but anybody can speculate, and and I think everybody did a lot of speculation during that period of time and Magen never came in the mix, so...    
    
Reporter: Did she, was she forthcoming about maybe the last time she saw her?    
    
Tim Miller: Well I asked I said now have you talked to detectives? And Magen said yeah they they called me because you know it looks like maybe I was the last one to talk to her, and we talked that morning prolly around 8:30, because she uh was having problems breastfeeding. And I said but you didn't tell them about all this other stuff you're telling me? And she said no they didn't ask me about anything, they just asked me what our last conversation was like. And I said Magen don't you think maybe you need to call them, uh I said it sounds like maybe there's some information about Shane and that relationship that they really need to know, and you being a best friend, it couldn't come from anybody better. So uh she certainly had me convinced, that uh I just cried on the phone. So then last night when we was up there at the house I started thinking about it, yeah when she was talking to me on the phone she may had the phone in one hand and the baby in the other, and Heidi in the back, so I I don't I don't know.    
    
Reporter: Your conversation with her was Sunday.    
    
Tim Miller: Sunday, Sunday afternoon, probably 3:30,4:00.    
    
Reporter: And you called her and she picked up, right?    
    
Tim Miller: Yeah, she picked up immediately.    
    
Reporter: And her conversation with Heidi was, you said, 8:30 the morning ...    
    
Tim Miller: 8:30 the morning she disappeared. So now it appears as though she was probably in Austin when when that happened, I don't know, I mean, certainly that's up to the detectives now to make sure get phone records and different things...    
    
Reporter: She told you she talked to detectives? They called her.    
    
Tim Miller: She talked to detectives. They asked one question when was last time you talked to her? You know, what was her mood? What she talked about, well, she's having problems breastfeeding. I said, nothing else? No, that was it. She was in a good mood, just having problems breastfeeding.    
    
Reporter: Did you know at the time, or have you learned, that Magen has different aliases? That she seems to move around a lot...    
    
Tim Miller: Yeah, I I have heard that, I really haven't looked into it. We've been busy, and you know, again it falls into the speculation and rumor stuff and everything, but there's got to be a reason for that, doesn't there.

Could you please describe where you see a car seat in your pictures? It is not my intention to argue with you, since you were there (thank you for the pics). But I just don’t see anything that looks like an infant carrier or a child’s car seat (the son’s?) On the top side of that first picture I see something gray on the seat that might resemble an infant carrier base?    
    
This is interesting to me - given we don’t know if the baby was in her own car seat when taken. Or as others have pondered, if MF had registered for a car seat of her own. Where the baby’s own carrier is makes me ponder more about what happened at HB’s apartment at the point of kidnapping. Seems like if the infant carrier is truly missing the baby could’ve just been sitting on the floor in the carrier the whole time that her mother was knocked unconscious and taken. Basically, if the baby was in a carrier it would’ve really given MF freedom of her own hands to keep the baby from HB or even come back in the house and get the baby later if she sleeping in her carrier.

We’ve learned Heidi Broussard and Magen Fieramusca met at church camp when they were young.    
    
Friends said the two were inseparable.    
    
A fellow roommate from that camp, KS, said they all stayed in the same dorm, and Heidi and Magen were attached at the hip.    
    
[…]    
    
It’s been forever since that church camp in Columbus where KS first met the two best friends. Heidi and Magen remained close over the years, but KS eventually lost touch.    
    
[…]    
    
“I hated my hair, and I remember, Magen sitting me down, her and Heidi, explaining that we’re not always going to like the way we look, but we’ve got to be confident and strong. I just remember them being very attentive to me, especially since I was the youngest in the dorm," KS said.

[DNA results could confirm soon if baby found alive belongs to murdered Austin mom](https://abc7news.com/dna-test-could-confirm-soon-if-baby-is-murdered-moms-daughter-/5779056/)    
DNA tests could confirm as soon as Monday if a baby found inside a Houston-area home belongs to murdered Austin mother Heidi Broussard.    
    
CPS says it's waiting for test results to confirm the identity of the girl believed to be Broussard's daughter Margot Carey.    
    
[…]    
    
An ABC13 camera captured an Austin Police Department vehicle exit the jail in downtown Houston at around 6:30 p.m. Friday. Fieramusca was crouched down in the passenger seat. The car arrived in Austin just after 9 p.m.    
    
[…]    
    
Medical examiners ruled Broussard's cause of death as "ligature strangulation."    
    
[...]    
    
Fieramusca, a former wedding planner with glowing reviews, appeared in court Friday afternoon for multiple previous charges related to six traffic tickets from April 2018 including expired registration, no driver's license on demand, driving while license invalid, failure to report change of address or name, expired driver's license and no car insurance.    
    
She pleaded no contest to all six tickets and was found guilty. She was fined $50 each for four of her outstanding tickets and $175 for the remaining two.

VM, who worked at Cracker Barrel with Broussard, said, "I knew how much she adored her family, so that has been the toughest of it all."    
    
VM said Broussard made everyone who walked into the restaurant feel like family. "It's going to be a very big void on behalf of all of her coworkers and the community because she was there for so long and I think that it'll be a while before everybody heals and continues on," she said.    
    
A funeral for Heidi Broussard will be held in Louisiana, but we don't know what day that will take place. Baby Margot is currently staying with Texas Child Protective Services as police continue their investigation.

[After Slaying of Tx. Mom and Recovery of Her Kidnapped Baby, Expert Speaks Out on Infant Abductions](https://people.com/crime/heidi-broussard-kidnapping-case-expert-speaks-out/)    
[…]    
    
Robert Lowery, the vice president of the Missing Children Division at the Virginia-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, says a “stereotypical infant abduction” often involves “a female abductor and the murder of the mother.”    
    
[…]    
    
Authorities have said Broussard was strangled to death, but final autopsy results are still pending, as are DNA test findings confirming the identity of the baby, who is in good health.    
    
[…]    
    
While Broussard’s friend, VS, tells PEOPLE that when she last saw her, Fieramusca told her she was pregnant and due to deliver her baby within a week. VS says that, to her, Fieramusca did not seem like someone who was about to give birth.    
    
Speaking generally about child abduction cases, Lowery says, “The motivation of these women who want an infant is almost always to preserve a relationship. They presented themselves as pregnant to a husband or boyfriend who they may be in a rocky relationship with to solidify their relationship, in most cases.”    
    
[...]    
    
Lowery notes that in almost every case where a mother is killed for her baby, the perpetrator is a woman. The babies, once recovered, are often found in good condition.    
    
[...]    
    
Lowery says the fact that Fieramusca is accused of kidnapping Broussard as well as Margot is unusual.    
    
“Typically, when we saw infant abductions like this, the mom would simply be murdered and the baby would be gone,” he explains. “When the mom is taken along with the baby, that doesn’t happen quite as often.”

CN added that Fieramusca called her “like five or six times a day” in the wake of Broussard’s disappearance.    
    
“We talked to 3 or 4 a.m. those first three nights,” CN said.    
    
CN said she never saw Fieramusca’s baby in person. Fieramusca also doesn’t have a Facebook page, she said, so she never saw a photo of the child.

“She was supposedly Heidi’s friend for a long time,” explains Tammy Broussard. “Heidi had so many friends. Everybody loved her. We thought Magen loved her too. But evidently that wasn’t the case. She wanted Margo, is what she wanted.”    
    
She adds, “But the thing is, I was uneasy with her, and I had [been] from the beginning of her friendship with Heidi.”    
    
[…]    
    
One of the victim’s friends, VS, tells PEOPLE she and Fieramusca were both in the delivery room when Margo was born in November.    
    
VS tells PEOPLE that when she last saw her, Fieramusca told her she was pregnant and due to deliver her baby within a week. VS says that, to her, Fieramusca did not seem like someone who was about to give birth.

“She always liked to go skydiving,” the grieving mother says. “She tried everything new. We took her to water parks. Me and her went on the highest rides and her daddy was like, ‘I don’t know.’ She loved water. She loved to swim. She loved to go anywhere where they had these rafting places.”    
    
[...]    
    
“This is just unreal because to even fathom that a person you thought was your friend to do this — it’s just unfathomable,” Tammy Broussard says. “She was supposed to be my daughter’s friend. We’re trying to make sense of it. Heidi has so many friends and she was supposed to be Heidi’s friend. Who does that to her friend?”

The two women, along with Broussard’s fiancé, Shane Carey, surrounded the 33-year-old Broussard as she began pushing in labor. Fieramusca stood at Broussard’s right, silently holding the hand of the friend she met years earlier at a Bible institute, recalls Shreves, who was holding up Broussard’s knees.    
    
“Magen was quiet. Somber,” says Shreves. “She wasn’t saying a word to her.”    
    
At 10:12 p.m., Margo Elizabeth Carey was born. Minutes later, Fieramusca “just left quickly,” Shreves tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue, on newsstands Friday.    
    
“Without a goodbye she was gone,” Shreves says. “I knew something was wrong.”    
    
[...]    
    
VS’ daughter, CN, and son, CF, 41, were also close to Broussard. Fieramusca told multiple friends that she had given birth and was settling in as a new mom.    
    
In a call with Fieramusca, CN could hear a baby in the background, CF says. Now the family is horrified that baby may have been Margo. “My sister didn’t know,” he says. “She can’t stop crying.”

"At this time, we have no information from the Travis County District Attorney’s Office regarding additional charges and do not know when Ms. Fieramusca will appear in court. As with every American accused of a crime, unless the State can prove these allegations beyond any reasonable doubt, Ms. Fieramusca is innocent."

Next Thursday, January 2nd, Magen Fieramusca will appear in court for the first time. The 460th District Court set a 9 AM hearing. She’s charged with kidnapping and tampering with the body of Heidi Broussard.    
    
Fieramusca’s lawyer, Austin Attorney JackieWood, tells KXAN they were given little information from prosecutors about the timeline and whether more charges will be coming.

Much of the more than week-long, statewide search for Margot and Broussard is still unknown. A judge sealed nearly all of the court documents usually open to the public. Officers at the Austin Police Department tell us they expect them to be sealed for at least another thirty days.

Heidi Elizabeth Broussard, 33, of Austin, TX died Thursday, December 19, 2019 in Houston, TX.    
    
Miss Broussard lived most of her life in Lake Charles. She lived her early childhood years in Cameron and past four years in Austin. She was a 2004 graduate of LaGrange High School. She worked mostly as a waitress, the past four years at Cracker Barrel. Heidi had a real soft spot for animals and was currently applying to further her education to work as a Veterinary Technician. She loved listening to music, singing and dancing. Her spirit brightened every room she entered, her smile and laughter brightened the day and her heart and guidance lifted countless many. Even as a child, Heidi was the welcoming friend, the neighborhood “herd of kids” place to gather. She had a servant’s heart, and everyone was her “best friend”. She also was sure to see that others had what they needed. She was adventurous and willing to try anything once! Heidi also had an overwhelming faith in the Lord and “saw God as Love”. During her younger years, she was an active member of Abundant Life Fellowship, church camp and youth group. She was a member of Life Church of Austin and found comfort in raising Silas in the church and had already attended her first Sunday with Margo. ^2pn-r

Funeral services will be at 2:00 PM Saturday, December 28, 2019 in the Johnson Funeral Home Chapel. Reverend Doyle Evans will officiate. Interment will follow in Highland Memory Gardens.

[Fiancé of murdered Texas mom refused to believe what he was seeing on TV | Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7824709/Fianc-murdered-Texas-mom-refused-believe-seeing-TV.html)    
[…]    
    
The fiancé of the murdered [Texas](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/texas/index.html) mom found stuffed into a car trunk and their baby stolen from her refused to believe what he was seeing on TV as the police found her body, his best friend has revealed.    
    
[…]    
    
He was with his best friend MQ as a local news helicopter showed cops surrounding a house and a silver Nissan belonging to Broussard's long-time friend Magen Fieramusca.    
    
[...]    
    
MQ also said the FBI asked Carey repeatedly about Fieramusca before they and other law enforcement officers swooped on her suburban Houston home.    
    
Initially, Quintanilla told true crime podcast [The Critical Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dqFDYaPftY), which has been following the case closely, that Carey thought the raid unfolding before his eyes was fake news and some sort of 'media' stunt.    
    
[…]    
    
By this time, Broussard and the couple's newborn daughter had been missing for a week. Carey had made two tearful appeals and spoke repeatedly to police, Texas Rangers and FBI agents.    
    
[...]    
    
'I got a gut feeling and started feeling sour about it. Shane came out the room. I started asking questions like, ''Shane, just sit down because this information is a little much''.    
    
'He sat down next to me, and first off, I asked him if he knew a silver Nissan. I showed him a picture and he said no.    
    
[…]    
    
'They said the medical examiners came out. There was a body in the trunk, there's a baby there. I asked him, ''who's Magen?''. He said ''wait, what are you talking about?''    
    
'I said ''look man, they've found Heidi in the trunk of this vehicle that's been parked in the back yard of this house.''    
    
'He was like ''shut the up man, don't talk to me, don't tell me this. Turn your phone off right now. This is the media.''    
    
[...]    
    
MQ continued: 'I said ''Shane, I love you man, I love you to death. This is breaking news. Why else would the police, Rangers, FBI, be at this house? It would be one thing if it was just Houston. But this might be really true.''    
    
'He didn't want to believe me. He was star struck kind of. He said ''don't tell me this s**t man, and his knees buckled a little bit.'    
    
MQ told the podcast that Carey's father, Ty, rushed over, having also heard the news about his intended daughter-in-law, and tried to console Carey.    
    
[…]    
    
MQ said Broussard's mother, Tammy, had been staying with them at their apartment helping to look after her daughter and new granddaughter, and they were all excited with the new member of their family.    
    
[…]    
    
'They even named the baby after Shane's grandma Margot,' he said.    
    
'Shane wears a pendant around his neck with the diamond ring that was his grandma's. He wears a silver necklace that has a stone in the middle.'    
    
[...]    
    
'There was a second round of interviews with detectives once the FBI agents were involved,' the 29-year-old told the podcast.    
    
'They've been drilling him about this woman named Magen, over and over.    
    
'They knew something before. Monday [December 16] was the day he did that interview. He said they were drilling him with questions about anything to do with Magen. They brought her up multiple times.'

Investigators are attempting to determine if Fieramusca kidnapped Broussard and her daughter in a plot to keep the baby as her own, an official briefed on the probe told ABC News.    
    
Murder charges are pending the outcome of the investigation, officials said.

In their first comments on the case, Fieramusco's attorneys Jackie Wood and Brian Erskine said on Thursday that they are "anxious to review the evidence collected thus far."    
    
"We are in the beginning stages of a very long process, but there are many questions that need to be answered," Wood and Erskine said in a joint statement to ABC News. "At this time, we have no information from the Travis County District Attorney's Office regarding additional charges and do not know when Ms. Fieramusco will appear in court.    
    
"As with every American accused of a crime, unless the State can prove these allegations beyond reasonable doubt, Ms. Fieramusca is innocent," the lawyers said.    
    
[…]    
    
Fieramusca had allegedly been acting like she was pregnant and telling people that she was expecting a child, an official briefed on the probe told ABC News. Authorities are now trying to determine whether she was, in fact, pregnant, the official said.    
    
Baby registries allegedly connected to the Fieramusca were found online indicating her due date was Dec. 1, the official said.

The document said Fieramusca acted suspiciously soon after Margot was born at the hospital in Austin, and that Margot’s grandfather noted that she interrupted his first meeting with his granddaughter, asking to hold the baby first.    
    
Fieramusca also had a key to Broussard’s South Austin apartment and told Margot’s father, Shane Carey, that she would leave it on a counter. He later told police that he never found the key.    
    
On Dec. 18, six days after Broussard and her baby disappeared, police also interviewed a woman who lived in their apartment complex who told police that she saw two women interacting and that one of them appeared to carrying an infant police think was Margot.

[Unsealed affidavit reveals what may have happened to Heidi Broussard before her death](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/austin-heidi-broussard-affidavit-magen-fieramusca/269-d4b31389-6da1-4bac-80e6-f23dd904c683)    
On Dec. 8 or 9, Shane Carey reported that he learned Fieramusca delivered a baby girl, but said he did not see any pictures of the baby.    
    
According to the affidavit, a person who lives at the same apartment complex Broussard lived in, had video cameras outside of his residence that captured a vehicle consistent with Fieramuca's car driving at the complex around 9 a.m. on Dec. 12, the same day Broussard and Margot Carey went missing.    
    
One witness said that on Dec. 11 or 12, she saw an adult white woman at the apartment complex carrying a small baby and walking towards a parked car. The witness reportedly told police she then saw another woman exit the car and greet the woman carrying the baby. The two women and baby then entered the car and drove away, according to the affidavit.    
    
On Dec. 19, the witness was presented with a photo lineup that Fieramusca was in. Police said the witness was 60% to 70% positive that the woman she saw in the front seat of the vehicle at the apartment complex was Fieramusca.    
    
Upon further investigation, officials found that Fieramusca conducted suspicious internet searches.    
    
Police said Fieramusca reportedly searched for "reasons for Amber Alert" and "Amber alert issued Austin" on Dec. 12.    
    
A full review of searches between Nov. 11 and Dec. 18 revealed that some form of "Heidi Broussard" was searched at least 162 times from a device using an account that lists Fieramusca's name.    
    
On Dec. 14, Fieramusca allegedly searched "bodies found in Austin Texas."    
    
According to the affidavit, data from T-Mobile revealed that Fieramusca's phone was in the Austin area near Broussard and Shane Carey's apartment on Dec. 12.    
    
Authorities then began doing surveillance on the Houston-area home where Fieramusca was living. Officials said they found her car parked in a way that appeared to be an attempt to hide it.

According to the affidavit, when Broussard gave birth to Margot, Fieramusca was one of three people (the baby’s father Shane Carey and another woman) in the delivery room at St. David’s South Austin Hospital. Fieramusca, who at the time said she was 37 weeks pregnant herself, drove from her home in Houston to be there for the birth Nov. 26.    
    
After the birth, family members came into the room. When the baby’s paternal grandfather, was handed the baby to hold, Fieramusca interjected herself and wanted to hold the baby, saying she had to leave, the affidavit said.    
    
Fieramusca stayed at Carey and Broussard’s apartment on the 700 block of W. William Cannon Drive that night, the affidavit says. Carey gave Fieramusca a key, and Carey said afterward he never found the key he let Fieramusca borrow, the affidavit said.

Fieramusca’s ex-boyfriend was living with her at the 8100 block of Bo Jack Drive in Houston. He said he believed he was the father of Fieramusca’s child, and said he noticed her belly growing as time passed, the affidavit said.    
    
The ex-boyfriend said he felt Fieramusca’s stomach and said it felt “hard.” He said he never saw Fieramusca’s bare stomach because their relationship, at the time, “did not lend itself to seeing her in stages of undress,” the affidavit said. The two broke up in March, the affidavit said.

Broussard’s body was found in a duffel bag in the trunk of a car in the Northwest Houston area last month, outside a home where Fieramusca was living. ...    
    
[...]    
    
On Dec. 18, six days after Broussard and her baby disappeared, police also interviewed a woman who lived in their apartment complex who told police that she saw two women interacting and that one of them appeared to be carrying an infant police think was Margot. The other woman, the neighbor revealed, resembled a person in a photo lineup that police say was Fieramusca.    
    
As authorities began investigating Fieramusca, they obtained a search warrant for information about her Internet search history. The affidavit said she had searched for “bodies found in Austin, Texas” on Dec. 14. Fieramusca’s Facebook account, active since 2008, was terminated while authorities were investigating Broussard’s disappearance on Dec. 17.

The neighbor who saw the women together near Broussard’s apartment raised suspicion that a second person could have been involved, noting in her interview with police that Fieramusca was in the front passenger seat of a vehicle that Broussard and Margot entered from the back. The affidavit did not mention who was driving.    
    
Although the criminal case is currently playing out in Travis County, it’s possible that another jurisdiction could pick it up if evidence shows Broussard was killed elsewhere.

On the day of Broussard's disappearance, police say surveillance video showed a car resembling Fieramusca’s drive toward the rear of the apartment complex, where Carey and Broussard’s apartment was, at 9:05 a.m. Cell phone data also placed Fieramusca's in the same area.    
    
A witness at the apartment complex says she spotted a woman with an infant in a knit cap get into that vehicle where another woman was already waiting, and, according to the affidavit, it didn't seem that the woman had enough time to properly restrain the baby before leaving the parking lot.

[...]    
    
In an affidavit for the arrest Fieramusca obtained by ABC13, six days after Broussard's disappearance on Dec. 12, police began diving into Fieramusca's social media activity.    
    
Police discovered she had deactivated her Facebook account the day before. According to the documents, a review of her Google search history revealed troubling inquiries.    
    
The evening Broussard went missing, Fieramusca searched "reasons for Amber Alert" and "Amber Alert issued Austin."    
    
Two days later, according to the affidavit, she searched "bodies found in Austin Texas." Documents also show over the previous month, Fieramusca searched some form of "Heidi Broussard" online at least 162 times.    
    
[...]    
    
... Fieramusca left the hospital about an hour after Broussard delivered the baby, according to documents, and returned to the apartment, where she reportedly stayed for two days and then returned to Houston.

Carey told GMA he never would have suspected Fieramusca because they were so close.    
    
"Heidi loved Megan. I mean they had a great relationship. I went over in my head about 1,000 times I should have been there. I should have noticed something," he continued.    
    
Fieramusca was present when Heidi gave birth to Margot and a son, who is 6 years old. She also took part in the search for Broussard.

“She deserves more. She deserves way more,” Heidi Broussard’s fiance, Shane Carey, told ABC News in an exclusive interview airing on _Good Morning America_ Thursday. “I’m waiting for that text message, like, ‘Hey sweetie, how we doing?’ … Just waiting to hear her voice. I still don’t believe it. I just don’t believe it. It’s really not real.”

“I want to look at her straight in the eyes and ask her why?” Carey said of Fieramusca. “That’s all I want to say. There’s no reason for any of this. I believe somebody talked her into it. I mean, from knowing Magen, I would never imagine it.”

Carey, Broussard’s fiance, expressed frustration over the way the case was unfolding and questioned why Fieramusca hadn’t been charged with murder.    
    
“I guess it’s tampering with evidence, [but] how is no one charged [with murder]? … There has to be someone charged,” Carey said. “I don’t know why this happened. She had my baby in her room supposedly. So it had to be her. … She had to be involved.”    
    
For now, Carey said he’s trying to stay strong for baby Margot. He’s also preparing to launch a foundation in Heidi’s memory called “Heidi and Shane’s Family Fund,” to support families who have suffered traumatic events.

_From the article:_    
The boyfriend of Heidi Broussard's alleged kidnapper has left the home where the Austin mom's body was found and moved in with his mother, DailyMailTV can disclose.    
    
[...]    
    
Green has not been seen since Fieramusca was arrested but DailyMailTV was able to track him to his mother Christine's home in a Houston suburb.    
    
[...]    
    
The 33-year-old, pictured for the first time since Fieramusca's arrest in exclusive DailyMailTV photos, has been living there since December 19 when cops swooped on his $149,000 property.    
    
He is still driving the same battered black Nissan Armada SUV he was in when he was stopped by the Texas Rangers at Target.    
    
[...]    
    
This week, his mother Christine, 54, confirmed to DailyMailTV that he is living with her but said he won't discuss the case until all the legal proceedings are complete.    
    
She said: 'Yeah, he's back here. He's not speaking to any media right now. He's got an attorney and he's got a lot of things going on.'    
    
Although she declined to pass a message to Heidi's grieving family, Christine said of her son: 'He's doing just fine. He's doing well. But he's got a lot to deal with right now.

The church family, as well as family and friends, of Heidi Broussard said goodbye to the Austin mother on Saturday afternoon.    
    
[Christian Life Church](http://clcaustin.com/) in South Austin is where Broussard spent several Sundays, often taking pictures at the church photo booth, her pastor Rex Johnson said.    
    
“Heidi Broussard loved God. She loved family. She loved her kids. She loved her fiancé sitting here,” Johnson said. “Death may end lives, but it can never end relationships. It can end the physical, but it'll never end the spiritual.”    
    
[...]    
    
The picture that’s been seen around the world of Broussard in front of a green foliage background was taken in the church lobby. It’s where Johnson said Broussard took weekly pictures to show off her progress as she was pregnant with baby Margot.    
    
[...]    
    
“Heidi, we bid you farewell. We don't say goodbye; we just say goodnight, 'cause we'll see you in the morning. God bless you,” Johnson said.

[Experts explain the 'maternal desire' psychology behind Heidi Broussard baby kidnapping](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/FBI-says-Magen-Fieramusca-charged-with-14970795.php)    
[...]    
    
In rare cases, the fantasy leads to criminal acts: stealing a child, or kidnapping and killing a mother a taking her child.    
    
FBI behavioral analysts believe a Houston woman was driven to kidnap her friend’s infant and hide the mother’s corpse in a car in her backyard by an overwhelming compulsion to have a baby that they term “maternal desire.”    
    
[...]    
    
“The desire to have a child can become pathological,” said Asim Shah, professor and executive vice chair of Community Psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine. “When the woman so desperately wants a child, she may try to take one from somebody close to her.”    
    
**More Information**    
    
Profile of an infant abductor, based on an analysis of cases that occurred between 1983 and 2007 by the National Center for Missing and Endangered Children:    
    
Usually female of "childbearing" age (between 12 and 50.)    
    
Often overweight.    
    
Compulsive and frequently relies on manipulation, lying and deception.    
    
Usually states she has lost a baby, or is incapable of having a child.    
    
Often married or cohabiting with a male partner.    
    
Frequently, the abductor lives or is familiar with the community where the abduction takes place.    
    
Usually visits the nursery or maternity ward at more than one healthcare facility prior to the abduction, and has asked detailed questions about procedures and the maternity floor layout.    
    
May also try to abduct from the home setting.    
    
[...]    
    
The motive of maternal desire may develop after one or more failed pregnancies. Or a woman who has not been pregnant may completely fabricate a pregnancy.    
    
The women driven by the compulsive desire to have a baby meticulously plan schemes to obtain infants. The lengths women have gone to range from impersonating medical workers to quietly steal children to befriending and manipulating pregnant women to gain access to their babies.    
    
[...]    
    
“It’s erratic, abnormal behavior,” Shah said. “It happens usually in people who are either depressed, anxious, have a psychosis or personality disorder, or are in a delusional state.”    
    
[...]    
    
There have been 327 infant abductions across the nation since 1964, according to an analysis by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Of those, only about 5 percent were reportedly motivated by maternal desire.    
    
Though violent infant abductions fueled by a woman’s pathological obsession with becoming a mother are relatively rare, recent cases have devastated communities across the nation. A 2017 case in Houston was apparently sparked by a miscarriage.    
    
[...]    
    
Some cases don’t end in bloodshed. In Pittsburgh in 2012, Breona Moore, then 19, told her boyfriend that he couldn’t break up with her because she was pregnant. But she wasn’t. Instead, Moore [impersonated a nurse and stole a newborn baby](https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2014/06/24/woman-accused-of-impersonating-nurse-stealing-baby-to-be-sentenced/) from Magee-Womens Hospital. She posted baby photos on social media and convinced her friends and family that the baby was hers. She was sentenced to five years in prison.    
    
[...]    
    
**Elaborate planning**    
    
In the first phase of an infant abduction motivated by maternal desire, psychiatric professionals say, studies of the cases indicate the women went to great lengths to use deception to act out a pregnancy fantasy.    
    
In Fiearmusca’s case, her warrant says all the people around her believed she was pregnant, including Broussard. Green said he touched Fieramusca’s stomach, and that it felt hard like she was pregnant, but never saw her bare stomach.    
    
[...]    
    
In cases in which the woman was never pregnant in the first place, she may pretend to be pregnant because she perceives mothers to be held in a higher regard in society and desperately wants to be one. In other cases, the woman may want to restore a failing relationship.    
    
“They may be insecure in a relationship and their hope is that if they have a child, their relationship will be secure,” said Sanjay Adahia, a forensic psychiatrist at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth.    
    
[...]    
    
In maternal desire abductions, psychiatrists say the act of taking the baby is not impulsive -- it’s been planned extensively. The women rehearse their stories and become obsessed with their plan. They may impersonate a healthcare professional or nanny to gain access to a baby, or they may befriend an expecting mother.    
    
Fieramusca had known Broussard for more than a decade, talked to her on the phone regularly and was there for the birth of Margo on Nov. 26, police said.    
    
“They will try to copy the person that is actually pregnant,” said Shah.    
    
Fieramusca told Broussard that they had conceived at the same, police said. The online baby registry lists Dec. 12 — the day Broussard went missing — as Fieramusca’s delivery due date.    
    
[...]    
    
In the final phase, after the baby has been taken, the woman will attempt to enter the child into her social circle as her own.    
    
“They are so focused on the child that they end up believing that they are actually the mother,” Shah said.    
    
**Warning signs**    
    
The intensity of the would-be mother’s emotions can sometimes provide warning signs.    
    
Broussard’s family found it odd when Fieramusca interrupted Margo’s first meeting with her grandfather in the hospital so she could hold the baby.    
    
Such possessive behavior toward a baby can be a sign of an unhealthy desire, Adahia said.

Sometimes, women with maternal desire will turn violent if they don’t get what they want. For instance, in July 2019, Clarissa Figueroa and her daughter Desiree Figueroa, of Chicago, were slapped with murder charges after they allegedly ripped a baby from his mother’s womb, then strangled the mother to death.    
    
In 2017, Brooke Crews and William Hoehn were arrested after authorities found North Dakota mom Savanna Greywind’s newborn in their apartment. Investigators later found Greywind dead and tossed near a river. The suspects were accused of [luring Greywind to their apartment](https://www.crimeonline.com/2018/12/26/she-is-a-happy-little-girl-more-than-a-year-later-baby-stolen-from-slain-mothers-womb-is-striving-father-says/) and cutting the baby girl from her womb.    
    
[...]    
    
According to “Legal and Criminological Psychology,” Volume 7, Issue 1, maternal desire abductions are typically carried out by “non-familial female perpetrators.” It’s also considered extremely rare.    
    
According to Beth Alberts, CEO of the Texas Center for the Missing and director of the Houston Regional Amber Plan, newborn abductions used to take place mostly in hospitals. Women are now targeting friends or acquaintances after hospitals across the nation upped security measures.

“It’s not usually random. It certainly could be, but no, usually the person [has sort of stalked the mother](https://abc13.com/what-is-a-baby-replacement-abduction/5772278/), watched the pregnancy and sometimes befriended the woman to get close to her and basically get access,” Alberts told ABC 13.

On this edition of Websleuths Radio Podcast we welcome our favorite true crime reporter Leigh Egan from Crimeonline.com. What is the latest in the murder of Paighton Houston? Police had a suspect in custody, but they let him go because of lack of evidence. Now they want to charge him with “abuse of a corpse” but they can’t find him. Leigh gives us the latest. Anthony Todt confessed to killing his family along with their dog but why and what was his “noticeable smell” all about? Finally, Leigh updates us on the tragic case of Heidi Broussard. Heidi was murdered allegedly by a childhood friend for her baby. Are we any close to finding out the truth about what Magen Fieramusca

In an affidavit for the arrest of Fieramusca obtained by ABC13, six days after Broussard's disappearance on Dec. 12, police began diving into Fieramusca's social media activity.    
    
Police discovered she had deactivated her Facebook account the day before. According to the documents, a review of her Google search history revealed troubling inquiries.    
    
The evening Broussard went missing, Fieramusca searched "reasons for Amber Alert" and "Amber Alert issued Austin."    
    
Two days later, according to the affidavit, she searched "bodies found in Austin Texas." Documents also show over the previous month, Fieramusca searched some form of "Heidi Broussard" online at least 162 times.

**Capital Murder in Texas and Death Penalty Punishment:**    
    
TRIAL    
    
A capital murder prosecution begins when the grand jury hands down an indictment charging a defendant with capital murder. The trial, which occurs in a Texas district court, proceeds in two phases.    
    
During the first phase of the trial, called the guilt/innocence phase, the jury must decide whether the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of capital murder.    
    
If the jury finds the defendant guilty, that trial proceeds to the punishment phase, during which the jury answers special punishment issues.    
    
The jury’s answers to the special issues determine whether the defendant is sentenced to death or to life imprisonment.

The defense claimed in documents it "had not received a single piece of evidence in the cases pending against Ms. Fieramusca."    
    
The Travis County District Attorney's Office responded Monday morning, indicating prosecutors have provided more than 50 items of discovery to Fieramusca’s attorneys.    
    
Judge Puryear said he won’t require state to disclose what information was provided to grand jury for Fieramusca’s capital murder indictment. He won’t impose sanctions and asked state to provide info as its received.

The court appearance was the first in the capital murder case against Magen Fieramusca, who is accused of being driven to kill her close friend due to [a compulsive desire to have a baby](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/FBI-says-Magen-Fieramusca-charged-with-14970795.php#).

[...]    
    
Attorneys representing Fieramusca said in a news conference that they had not received any evidence in the cases against the woman.    
    
A defense motion filed last week asked for sanctions on the DA’s office if it does not "produce all evidence in its possession and in the possession of any and all of the law enforcement agencies which investigated these allegations" by 5 p.m. Monday, [according to KVUE ABC](https://www.kvue.com/article/news/crime/magen-fieramusca-scheduled-to-have-hearing-in-heidi-broussard-case/269-13b5298c-e2a7-45dc-aa86-b308f910101d) in Austin.    
    
Judge Geoffrey Puryear did not grant the motion and said he trusted prosecutors to make evidence available to the defense, KVUE reported. Prosecutors have filed more than 50 pieces of discovery in the case so far, court documents show.

['Dateline' examines 'chilling' disappearance of Texas mother, Heidi Broussard, and baby daughter (mytwintiers.com)](https://www.mytwintiers.com/news-cat/national/dateline-examines-chilling-disappearance-of-texas-mother-heidi-broussard-and-baby-daughter/)    
We begin our story in Austin, Texas. Thursday, Dec. 12, 2019, two weeks after Margot was born.    
    
It was a typical busy morning for 33-year-old Heidi. The bubbly young mom lived with her fiance, Shane Carey, and their two children in this modest apartment complex.    
    
The day started early, seeing Shane off to work, tending to baby Margot and getting her six-year old-son, Silas, to school.    
    
DESTINY FINE: I think she probably woke Silas up and started to get the baby ready while Silas got himself dressed.    
    
Destiny Fine was one of Heidi’s closest friends.    
    
DESTINY FINE: They probably brushed their teeth together, because they did that quite often. I’m sure she made his lunch and got his breakfast ready, and then they got out the door as quick as they could.    
    
Heidi dropped Silas off at school shortly after 8 a.m. nothing out of the norm there. Hours later, her fiance, Shane, got home from work, expecting to see Heidi and baby Margot. After all, he saw Heidi’s car in the parking lot, when he pulled in. But Heidi and Margot weren’t home.    
    
DESTINY FINE: Now, she was supposed to hang out with a friend that day. I think he just thought that she had went to hang out with her friend early.    
    
Shane wasn’t too worried and went about his day. But as the hours passed, he realized his son needed to be picked up from after-school activities so he headed out to get him. And when he and Silas got home still no Heidi or Margot. That’s when Shane became alarmed.    
    
REBEKAH GUILLORY: I spoke to Shane Thursday night. He asked me if I had heard from her, “Have you talked to Heidi today? Because I can’t find her, Bekah. I can’t find her.”    
    
Rebekah lived hours away in Houston but was like a sister to Heidi and talked to her all the time.    
    
REBEKAH GUILLORY: He’s like, “I went and got Silas, but I– I– I don’t know where Heidi is.” And I’m like, “Well, where’s Margot?” Well, he says, “She must have her. I don’t have her.”    
    
ANDREA CANNING: Gives you chills.    
    
REBEKAH GUILLORY: Oh, absolutely.

During the morning portion of the hearing, Fieramusca’s defense requested a motion to suppress evidence on the basis that Texas Rangers entered Fieramusca’s Houston home on Dec. 19, 2019, at 1:17 p.m. without a warrant. The defense claimed Texas Rangers didn’t have probable cause to enter the home at that time. A warrant was eventually issued later that day at 8:30 p.m. ^fm4v2  
    
The burden then shifted to the state to establish why there was probable cause to enter the home without a search warrant. ^jeheh  
    
The state cited three exceptions justifying the search and seizure of the home at that time: 1) law enforcement isn’t required to show probable cause when action is immediately necessary to protect human life, 2) there was an objective standard of reasonableness to enter, given the facts and circumstances of the case and 3) consent was given by someone authorized to provide consent, allowing Texas Rangers to enter the home without a warrant. ^glkhr

During Thursday's hearing, [Austin Police Department](https://www.austintexas.gov/department/police) Sgt. Brad Herries and Texas Rangers Christopher Rainwater and Gary Phillips testified regarding the investigation leading up to Fieramusca's arrest. Law enforcement had taken Fieramusca's boyfriend into custody leading up to finding Broussard's body and her baby, Margo Carey, alive in Christopher Green's home.    
    
According to a recording played in front of the Judge Thursday, Green questioned Texas Rangers saying, "She’s not my child? Are you serious?" and “Go get that baby, what are y’all waiting for, man?"

He _[lead detective]_ explained how Fieramusca became a person of interest after speaking with Carey, who told him at the time a friend of Broussard’s had a pregnancy around the same time, but there weren’t any pictures of the baby. A search for Fieramusca’s Facebook page found the account had been deleted, which the former detective also found to be unusual, given the timing. ^ge8gn  
    
The sergeant told the court officers went to the hospital where Broussard’s baby was born, and nurses told them they remembered Fieramusca being there and wanting to hold the child before the actual family could. ^gc-ro

Texas Rangers stopped a man, Chris Green, who was buying baby products. Green said he was previously in a relationship with Fieramusca, and they still lived together. Green stated Fieramusca had just gotten home with their newborn baby on the same day Broussard and her baby went missing in Austin, according to the sergeant. When Texas Rangers showed Green a picture of the missing baby, Green confirmed that was the same baby in Fieramusca’s home. ^3i1s7

One of two Texas Rangers who testified explained they did a “protective sweep” of the house to find the baby. Once the baby was found safe, he ordered everyone to exit the home, because they didn’t have a search warrant. ^nh80o  
    
Further, the Texas Ranger said they noticed the smell of a decomposing body and traced it to the car but didn’t search or seize anything until the search warrant was obtained later that day. It was only until after the search warrant was issued did the Rangers find Broussard’s body in the trunk of the car and ordered Fieramusca to be arrested. ^ihh5w

A judge will wait to rule on a motion to suppress evidence in the case of a woman accused of killing her best friend, Heidi Broussard, kidnapping Broussard’s newborn baby and pretending it was her own. ^75u2y  
    
[,,,]    
    
The first witness from the state Friday morning was a trooper who told the state he was coordinating with the FBI early in the case and would later become the first member of law enforcement to make contact with the then-missing baby. ^1drdi  
    
[...]    
    
Video shown by the defense from an FBI surveillance plane showed Fieramusca was still in the backyard when law enforcement arrived. ^yo6tc  
    
Lopez said shortly after arriving he hopped the fence to get access to the back of the house. He told the state he jumped the fence because Fieramusca requested she be allowed to go back inside to meet law enforcement in the front, instead of opening a rear gate for them, saying he was worried if she went back to the baby “she would kill it.” ^3xhd1  
    
“The reason I jumped over the fence was because there was a kidnapped baby inside this house,” he later told the defense when they cross-examined him. ^zhlox  
    
[...]    
    
The next witness, and the witness that was left on the stand before the court broke for lunch, was Daron Parker, a Texas Ranger. Parker was one of the first to make contact with Fieramusca as law enforcement approached the Houston suburb home, he said. ^12kxx  
    
He was also assigned to stand with Fieramusca between the time law enforcement made contact with her until roughly eight hours later, when someone from the Austin Police Department took over. Parker had an audio recording device on him which recorded that roughly eight-hour interaction, he testified. ^7aekd

Fieramusca's defense attorneys pointed out that Texas Ranger Eric Lopez started a crime scene log at 1:25 p.m. that day. He submitted photos to evidence that were taken in bright sunlight. However, a search warrant was not secured until 8:53 p.m. Sunset in Houston was 5:26 p.m. ^r6w9-

[Defense: Texas Rangers searched home of woman accused of killing friend, kidnapping baby without warrant | KRQE News 13](https://www.krqe.com/news/national/defense-texas-rangers-searched-home-of-woman-accused-of-killing-friend-kidnapping-baby-without-warrant/)    
The state cited three exceptions justifying the search and seizure of the home at that time: 1) law enforcement isn’t required to show probable cause when action is immediately necessary to protect human life, 2) there was an objective standard of reasonableness to enter, given the facts and circumstances of the case and 3) consent was given by someone authorized to provide consent, allowing Texas Rangers to enter the home without a warrant.    
    
The state called its first witness, who was the lead detective on the case and is now a sergeant. He explained all the events leading up to Texas Rangers entering the home.    
    
He recalled how he was first notified of the disappearance of Broussard and her newborn on Dec. 12, 2019. He explained the case became a high priority after speaking with the baby’s father, Shane Carey, and learning items necessary to care for a newborn were still at Broussard’s apartment. There were also medical concerns, due to the baby having jaundice.    
    
The sergeant then stated multiple agencies got involved, including the Texas Department of Public Safety, Texas Rangers and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as a number of local agencies and nonprofits. The FBI also deployed its Child Abduction Rapid Deployment Unit and set up a command post at an Austin Police Department office in south Austin, according to the sergeant.    
    
He explained how Fieramusca became a person of interest after speaking with Carey, who told him at the time a friend of Broussard’s had a pregnancy around the same time, but there weren’t any pictures of the baby. A search for Fieramusca’s Facebook page found the account had been deleted, which the former detective also found to be unusual, given the timing.

[Baby Snatcher ‘Bestie Killer’ to Walk Free? Defense Argues Search Warrant Never Served in Heidi Broussard Murder](https://www.crimeonline.com/2022/03/29/baby-snatcher-bestie-killer-to-walk-free-defense-argues-search-warrant-never-served-in-heidi-broussard-murder/)    
_A hearing for a Texas woman accused of killing her best friend and kidnapping her baby is underway in Travis County.    
    
According to court documents, the hearing is in connection with capital murder charges against Magen Fieramusca, who stands accused of killing her friend, Heidi Broussard, in 2019, then kidnapping her newborn daughter. Fieramusca, 36, is also charged with tampering with evidence. She’s been behind bars since December 2019, awaiting trial. Her bond is $1.6 million.    
    
The defendant’s lawyers argued last week that prior to entering the home where the defendant was found, investigators didn’t get a search warrant. In turn, the defense is requesting a motion to suppress the evidence found during the search.    
    
[...]    
    
The lead detective on the case (now a sergeant) testified that Fieramusca landed on his radar after Broussard’s fiancee, Shane Carey, who said Fieramusca was pregnant around the same time as Heidi, but there were no photos of her baby. Fieramusca also allegedly deleted her Facebook after Heidi disappeared, which the detective found troubling.    
    
He also stated that nurses at the hospital where Heidi gave birth remembered the defendant showing up and wanting to hold Heidi’s newborn before the family did.

At a court hearing on Thursday, May 12, Judge Selena Alvarenga denied her defense team's request. They claimed that the evidence was illegally obtained when investigators entered the Harris County home without a search warrant. The judge ruled that Fieramusca voluntarily spoke with law enforcement at the home and understood her rights._ ^m5n2g

Prosecutors testified that the home wasn't searched until warrants were signed.    
    
After a five-minute recess on Thursday, Judge Selena Alvarenga returned to the bench. She said during the investigation that law enforcement was following various leads, which led them to the home where Fieramusca was found with baby Margo.    
    
Judge Alvarenga said she believes law enforcement had reasonable, probable cause that a crime had been committed when they entered the home in pursuit of investigating a missing persons case. Law enforcement had reason to believe the baby could have been in imminent danger, the judge said. She said from the bench that the warrantless entrance was justified.

**Judge Selena Alvarenga set Fieramusca's arraignment hearing for Jan. 31. Her grand jury trial is set to begin on March 13.**    
    
In court Wednesday, **Alvarenga stated that Fieramusca's case "needs to move"** and that "both sides need a resolution."    
    
"Fieramusca has been in custody for 1,119 days," Alvarenga said, also stating, "Fact of the matter is, **this is a very old case**."_

By 'resolution', I'm assuming they mean some kind of a 'plea deal'? Would that be like Fieramusca pleads guilty so she doesn't get the death penalty?    
    
_**Fieramusca herself did not appear because she was placed in a COVID unit at the jail and couldn’t be brought in**, according to the court. However, the attorneys still met with the judge to provide updates on the case and reschedule the hearing.    
    
Once the attorneys approached the bench, the **judge addressed the fact that Fieramusca has been in custody for over 1,000 days and emphasized the need to move forward with the next steps** in the case.    
    
The **judge informed the attorneys that if the two parties could not agree on a resolution soon, the case would go to a jury trial this March.**    
    
Fieramusca is now scheduled to appear in court on Jan. 31 for her arraignment hearing.    
    
**This would have been Fieramusca’s first in-person court appearance since May 2022** when the state and defense attorneys presented arguments regarding the evidence the Texas Rangers obtained when they entered Fieramusca’s Houston home on Dec. 19, 2019._

"We hope that this outcome brings some closure and allows the Broussard and Carey families to continue their healing process," the Travis County DA's office said in a statement. "Our hearts continue to break for them and their immeasurable loss."    
    
Fieramusca was originally charged with capital murder. Fieramusca's attorney, Brian Erskine, said he felt the plea agreement was appropriate.    
    
"As charged, Ms. Fieramusca was looking at life without the possibility of parole," Erskine said. "After considerable discussion, in conjunction with significant compelling mitigation related to Ms. Fieramusca and the possible appellate issues related to the search of her residence, both parties feel that this is the appropriate resolution. I imagine many have questions that will never be adequately answered. Nevertheless, I hope that this plea brings some closure to this family’s great loss."

Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza said this plea, that includes Fieramusca waiving her right to appeal, will save the family from potentially decades of litigation.    
    
"People have the right to appeal to the Court of Appeals and to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and sometimes to the Supreme Court. And for a family, particularly for a family that has lost a loved one, living through that process can be very, very difficult. When we are able to secure a plea agreement that we think is a just outcome, it can save the family from that process," Garza said.

_"On January 31, the District Attorney’s Office expects Megan_ [Magen] _Fieramusca to plead guilty to the murder of Heidi Broussard. The plea is conditioned on Ms. Fieramusca receiving a sentence of 55 years and waiving her right to appeal, meaning that the defense will not be able to litigate decisions made by the Court during pre-trial litigation. We hope that this outcome brings some closure and allows the Broussard and Carey families to continue their healing process. Our hearts continue to break for them and their immeasurable loss."_

Broussard’s mother, Tammy, confirmed that she was told about the sentence and will be in court on Tuesday, Jan. 31.    
    
Broussard said she still doesn’t know why Magen killed her daughter, she said the two were supposed to be friends.    
    
“I have a big portrait of Heidi and Shane and the kids and I am bringing that and hopefully they will let me put it in the courtroom so that she can see what she has done, something that will remind her of what she has done,” Broussard said. “I don’t have any ill feelings towards her, God has set me at peace, and we just have to get this done.”

Magen Fieramusca is scheduled to appear in the 460th District Court of Travis County Tuesday to plead guilty to the 2019 murder of her best friend, Heidi Broussard. Due to the ice storm, Travis County Criminal courts posted on its website they are closed Tuesday, and KXAN has reached out to confirm what this means for Fieramusca’s case.

I couldn't find where this article was posted before, so posting it now:    
    
_Green told the Texas Rangers that he had witnessed Fieramusca's belly grow during her pregnancy, but they had a rocky relationship and he never saw her pregnant stomach. She told him she was carrying his child. **When a Ranger asked Green where she gave birth, he said, "She's been really distant with me about that stuff. I don't know why."**    
    
One day, Green came home, and there was an infant on the bed in his house, he told the Rangers. **He and Fieramusca named the child Luna.    
    
The Ranger also asked Green if he knew Broussard. He replied that Fieramusca knew her, and he knew she was missing.**_    
**_    
"Is that starting to make sense to you — how it might be tied together?" the Texas Ranger asked Green.    
_**    
_**"Tied together?" he repeated, baffled.**    
....    
**"It's fair to say y’all were right — the child was Margot, and Heidi was deceased,"** Brian Erskine, Fieramusca's attorney, said as he questioned a Ranger on the stand. "But you would agree with me that, **as terribly important as it is to protect children and their safety, that there are laws before you go into someone’s home**."_

Magen Fieramusca pleaded guilty Thursday to murdering her best friend, Heidi Broussard, in 2019. Travis County District Court Judge Selena Alvarenga sentenced her to 55 years in prison. ^4q5zh  
    
“It is difficult, if not impossible, to find justice for this horrendous crime. You have deprived an innocent child — an innocent baby — of the opportunity of growing up with her mother,” Alvarenga said to a tearful Fieramusca. ^ho9ac

“Heidi’s hugs were strong and full of love,” Broussard’s mother, Tammy, said to the court. “I still feel them now.” ^ud2ne

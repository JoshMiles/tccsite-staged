## The Script  
  
On Thursday the 12th of December 2019, in Houston Texas, 33 year old Mother of two [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) woke up in the apartment she shared with her fiance, [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#), and two children - her newly-born daughter, and her six year old son.  
  
[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) began to get the children ready for the day as her finance [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#) awoke and got ready to go to work.[^1] [^2]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) left for work at a moving company in North Austin at about 6:30am that morning.[^4]   
  
[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had been working at Cracker Barrel in Buda Texas since 2015, though, she had been put on maternity leave following the birth of the couple's [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#).[^3]   
  
And that morning, there had been a book fair taking place at her [Six Year Old Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#)'s school, so [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#), the [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#) and the [Six Year Old Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#) went to [Cowan Elementary](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Cowan-Elementary.md#) school to check it out.[^5]   
  
Though, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) hadn't stayed too long at the book fair, leaving with her baby at about 8:12pm after dropping her six year old off for the school day.[^6]   
  
At approximately **8:30am**, [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) phoned up [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) for a quick chat in which [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) confirmed to him that she'd dropped their six year old off at school.[^7]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) wouldn't call [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) again that day while he was at work until he finished, at approximately **1:50pm**.[^8] [^9]   
  
Though, when he called her, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) did not pick up and the phone and the call went to voicemail.[^10]   
  
Thinking nothing of it, [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) headed back to the apartment complex where he lived with his fiance and two children.  
  
He arrived at about 2.50pm in the parking lot of the complex, and straight away [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) noticed that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s car - a white 2012 [Honda Fit](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/01-Honda-Fit.md#) - had been parked in the lot.[^11]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) presumed [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and their [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#) must've been inside, and headed up to their [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#).  (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
When he got to the front door, he found it to have been left unlocked - though, this hadn't been something out of the ordinary for the family especially if somebody had already been at home.[^12]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) entered the apartment, and he was met with a scene of complete regularity - nothing was out of the ordinary, nothing was in disarray, the only thing that stood out to him was the fact that neither [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) nor their [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#) were inside.[^13] [^14]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) presumed that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and the baby might've been visiting with another apartment in the complex, which wasn't something unusual, or that they might've gone to the park - he wasn't worried.[^15]   
  
When the afternoon progressed into the early evening, and with [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) still nowhere to be seen, [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) realised that if [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) didn't have her car - which was still parked in the parking lot - she wouldn't be able to go pick up their [six year old child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#) from his after-school activities as she usually would, and so [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) decided to head on over to the school.[^16]   
  
He thought that maybe [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had got a lift there, or was with one of the other mums, and that he'd be able to meet her there, pick her up, and make sure everything was okay.[^17]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) arrived at [Cowan Elementary](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Cowan-Elementary.md#.md#) at about 5:50pm, collected the couple's [six year old child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#.md#), and waited.[^20]   
  
Maybe [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had been delayed, maybe she was running late, but by the time 6pm came and went, [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) had still not arrived to pick up their son.[^19]   
  
Now it is important to note that some accounts state that [Cowan Elementary](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Cowan-Elementary.md#.md#.md#) actually phoned up [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) to tell him that his [six year old child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#) hadn't been picked up from school yet but later reports suggest that not to have been the case. [^18]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#), after [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) failed to show up, decided to take their [six year old child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) back to the apartment thinking that maybe [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had returned there.[^21]   
  
But, when he got back, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and their baby was still nowhere to be seen.[^22]   
  
He settled their [six year old child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in the house, and popped out to the parking lot to see if there had been any suggestion as to where [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had gone in her car.[^23]   
  
He cautiously approached the car and pulled on the handle of the driver's door to find the vehicle to have been left unlocked - something that was very unusual.[^24]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) immediately noticed [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s red purse within the car, which still contained her wallet.[^25] [^26]   
  
All of her personal items, cash, credit cards, debit cards, and identification had been left untouched inside the purse.[^27]   
  
Now it is important to note that the couple's [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had suffered with jaundice following the birth, and so when they were discharged from the hospital, they had to supplement breast milk with formula to combat the jaundice.[^28]   
  
And to [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#)'s horror, all of the necessities needed for looking after the [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had remained within the apartment or in the vehicle; the diapers, the formula, clothing, wipes, bedding, the child seat for the car.[^29]   
  
And as we know, all apparent forms of financial means for [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had been left within her wallet, which in turn had been left in her car.[^30]   
  
There were only two items missing: [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s [iPhone 11](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Heidi-Cell-Phone.md#) and her set of [keys](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Heidi-Keys.md#).[^31]   
  
True panic set in for [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) as he began to ring up his friends and family in the area - desperate to find [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and their [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), though, nobody had any idea as to where they were.[^32]   
  
And so, at approximately 7:31pm, [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) called the Austin Police Department to report [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) and their newborn baby as missing.[^33]   
  
The responding officers conducted a deliberate search of the area surrounding the [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#), contacted members of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s family and friend group, conducted a reverse 911, calling over 4,000 residences in the immediate area of the [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#.md#), and released the names and images of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and the [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to the media.[^34]   
  
Though, as that December Thursday came to an end, [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) and her baby's whereabouts remained a mystery. [^35]   
  
The following day, on [Friday December 13th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-13-Friday-December-13-2019.md#), [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) provided his first initial statement to Austin Police Detectives [Brad Herries](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Herries.md#) and [Ryan Metcalf](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Metcalf.md#) at the Austin Police Department South Substation.[^36]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) was eager to cooperate, with the conversation being voluntary and recorded.[^37] [^38]   
  
Following the interview, [Detective Herries](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Herries.md#.md#) began to investigate [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#)'s cell phone number, which had been provided by [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#), and learnt that the number had been registered to [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) and had been on the T-Mobile network.[^39] [^40] [^41]   
  
[Detective Herries](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Herries.md#.md#) contacted T-Mobile who confirmed that they provided service for the number, and that the cell phone was currently showing to be on and active.[^42]   
  
The fact the cell phone was active kicked [Detective Herries](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Herries.md#.md#) straight into action.  (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
The detective presented a Surveillance Order with an Emergent Addendum to Travis County District Court [Judge J. Kocurek](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/01-Judge-Kocurek.md#) who reviewed the Order and approved it.[^43] [^44]   
  
This Order would allow the authorities to conduct an emergency ping for [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#)'s phone number, which they started at approximately 4:56pm on that December Friday.[^45]   
  
They hoped that this continuous ping would help them ascertain locational data associated with the use of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s cell phone, with the data updated and sent at fifteen minute intervals over the course of a 48 hour period.[^46] [^47]   
  
The following day, [Saturday December 14th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-14-Saturday-December-14th-2019.md#), the Austin Police launched a helicopter that circled the area of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#)'s apartment to aid in the search, with K9 units being deployed by Game Wardens.[^48]   
  
It had been on that Saturday that [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) made his first public plea for information pertaining to the whereabouts of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and their newborn baby.[^49]

[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s Mother also spoke with the press that day, and indicated that there wasn't anything wrong with [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) leading up to her disappearance, and that she couldn't think of anyone who might want to hurt her daughter.[^50]   
  
And later on that day, [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) spoke to the press again (though this time over the phone), here's an extract from the transcript of that conversation:[^51]   
  
>[!quote] [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)

[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) had met [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) back in 2009, and the couple had been engaged since November of 2012.[^53]   
  
[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) Elizabeth [Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) had been born in Lake Charles, Louisiana,  on the 4th of June 1986.[^54]   
  
Although she lived most of her life in Lake Charles, she did spend her early childhood years in Cameron and the past four years in Austin.[^55] [^56]   
  
Some reports suggest that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had also lived in Kyle, Texas, at some point with [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) but it's unclear when that had been.[^57]   
  
But what we do know is that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had graduated in 2004 from LaGrange High School and had studied to be a veterinary technician in college.[^58] [^59]   
  
You see, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had a massive soft spot for animals and, at the time of her disappearance, had been applying to further her education to work as a Veterinary Technician - working for the past four years at Cracker Barrel to help pay the bills.[^60] [^61]   
  
[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) was described as somebody who loved listening to music, sing, and dancing, and that her laughter brightened the day and her heart and guidance lifted countless many.[^62] [^63]   
  
Even as a child, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) was described as the welcoming friend, the neighbourhood "herd of kids" place to gather. [^66]   
  
She was remembered as having a servant's heart, and that everyone had been her "best friend" - ensuring that others had what they needed.[^64] [^65]   
  
She was adventurous and willing to try anything once, and had an overwhelming faith in the Lord and "saw God as Love"[^67]   
  
Let's take a listen to one of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s friends describe her:

When she was younger, she had been an active member of Abundant Life Fellowship, church camp and youth camp.[^68]   
  
And it had been at church camp that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#), at 11 years old, had met the her person - the person who would be her lifelong best friend, [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#).[^69]   
  
They had quickly become the best of friends after attending the Texas Bible Institute in Columbus, Texas - speaking over the phone regularly.[^70]   
  
And in 2019, in a happy coincidence, both [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) and [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) became pregnant at around the same time - expecting to bring their children into the world in late 2019. [^71] [^72]   
  
The best friends had even discussed the possibility of delivering on the same date - they really were each other's person, and supported one another through everything.[^73]   
  
And in the early hours of the morning of [Monday November 25th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-11-25-Monday-November-25th-2019.md#), [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#)'s water broke.[^74]   
  
[Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) rushed to St. David's South Austin Hospital in anticipation of the childbirth.[^75]   
  
The couple were quick to tell [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s best friend [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#) that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had gone into labour.  
  
And when [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) heard the wonderful news, she decided to drive from her home in Houston Texas to South Austin.[^76]   
  
That afternoon, [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had given [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) a key to their [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#.md#.md#) from [Heidi's keyring](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Heidi-Keys.md#.md#) so that she could use their apartment as a base.[^77]   
  
[Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) made it in time to be in the room when [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) delivered her baby, who we're calling the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in this coverage to protect the child's privacy.[^78] [^79] [^80]   
  
Also in the delivery room had been [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [V.S](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-VS.md#) - [V.S](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-VS.md#) being one of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s friends who has had their name abbreviated for the purposes of privacy protection.[^81] [^82]   
  
[Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) made sure to be there for her best friend, and even helped out after [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) was discharged from the hospital.  
  
And this love and care for her best friend only amplified after [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) went missing.  
  
Tim Miller from Eqqusearch had called up a number of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s friends after she went missing, including [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#), and this is what she told him.

>>**1:43:**  
>>"so my first call was to Magen. And she answered the phone, and I told her who I was, and she said yeah I've seen you on TV so many times and just thank you for helping find my friend, and I said well Magen, I said what's your heart telling you on this. And she's like, Shane did it. She says I was there 10 years ago when they met, I told Heidi stay away from this guy, he's trouble relationships on and off, there's been a lot of abuse going on, Shane keeps saying well that baby's not even mine and stuff, she called me back in May and said that her and Shane had a terrible fight, and and and she just went on and on and on and to the point that literally 45 minutes later, I said Magen, listen, I got it I got to go I'm getting a call on the other line. And said Mr. Miller thank you for what you're doing, she says I'm going to keep talking to people and everything if I come up with anything, is it okay if I call you? And I said Magen please do. Please call me. And I mean looking back at that conversation on Sunday to now, there was not one single indication that I would ever believe she had anything to do with it. So you know and she's at the hospital with Heidi when she has the baby, here she is after Heidi gets out at the house helping and everything"

>>**3:27:**

Thirteen days after [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had given birth, on either [Sunday December 8th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-12-08-Sunday-December-8th-2019.md#) or [Monday December 9th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-12-09-Monday-December-9th-2019.md#), almost as she had planned with [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#), [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) gave birth to a baby girl.[^83]   
  
The best friends had been in the journey of raising their newly-borns together.  (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
Which only made the sudden disappearance of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) that much more painful for all those who knew her.  (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
By the time the afternoon of [Sunday December 15th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-15-Sunday-December-15-2019.md#) came around, the continuous 48 hour ping had come to an end and it unfortunately provided no locational data for [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s cell phone, which indicated that the phone had not been in use during that time period.[^52]  
  
That same day, [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) made another emotional plea in the press.[^84]

On [Monday December 16th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-16-Monday-December-16th-2019.md#), [Shane Carey's Father](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Shane-Careys-Father.md#) told the press that he had setup a Facebook page the day before in an effort to raise money for a reward and for "expenses incurred during the search".[^85]   
  
As news of the Facebook page was published, the FBI and Texas Rangers joined the search efforts for [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and her [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^86]   
  
The investigators were attempting to remain neutral and had been trying to avoid jumping to any conclusions as they explored two possible angles: the first being that [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) had left on her own accord, and the second that [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) and her [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been the victims of foul-play.[^87] [^88]   
  
Investigators interviewed the neighbours in the complex where [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) lived, and completed an analysis of the [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#) for any potential forensic evidence, but they couldn't find any information that could answer their questions.[^89] [^90] [^91]   
  
An interview with [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in which his father had been present by the press was also published, let's take a look at [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#)'s account of what happened.

The next day, on [Tuesday December 17th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-17-Tuesday-December-17th-2019.md#), search parties were organised that included a group who had planed to use a drone to assist in the search.[^92]   
  
Meanwhile, detectives obtained surveillance footage from any premises in the area around the complex, as the FBI performed inspections of the cars.[^93] [^94]   
  
The investigators addressed the press that evening, let's take a look.[^95]

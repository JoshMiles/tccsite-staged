## The Script  
  
On Thursday the 12th of December 2019, in Houston Texas, 33 year old Mother of two [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) woke up in the apartment she shared with her fiance, [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#), and two children - her newly-born daughter, and her six year old son.  
  
[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) began to get the children ready for the day as her finance [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#) awoke and got ready to go to work.[^1] [^2]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) left for work at a moving company in North Austin at about 6:30am that morning.[^4]   
  
[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had been working at Cracker Barrel in Buda Texas since 2015, though, she had been put on maternity leave following the birth of the couple's [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#).[^3]   
  
And that morning, there had been a book fair taking place at her [Six Year Old Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#)'s school, so [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#), the [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#) and the [Six Year Old Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#) went to [Cowan Elementary](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Cowan-Elementary.md#) school to check it out.[^5]   
  
Though, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) hadn't stayed too long at the book fair, leaving with her baby at about 8:12pm after dropping her six year old off for the school day.[^6]   
  
At approximately **8:30am**, [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) phoned up [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) for a quick chat in which [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) confirmed to him that she'd dropped their six year old off at school.[^7]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) wouldn't call [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) again that day while he was at work until he finished, at approximately **1:50pm**.[^8] [^9]   
  
Though, when he called her, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) did not pick up and the phone and the call went to voicemail.[^10]   
  
Thinking nothing of it, [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) headed back to the apartment complex where he lived with his fiance and two children.  
  
He arrived at about 2.50pm in the parking lot of the complex, and straight away [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) noticed that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s car - a white 2012 [Honda Fit](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/01-Honda-Fit.md#) - had been parked in the lot.[^11]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) presumed [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and their [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#) must've been inside, and headed up to their [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#).  (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
When he got to the front door, he found it to have been left unlocked - though, this hadn't been something out of the ordinary for the family especially if somebody had already been at home.[^12]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) entered the apartment, and he was met with a scene of complete regularity - nothing was out of the ordinary, nothing was in disarray, the only thing that stood out to him was the fact that neither [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) nor their [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#) were inside.[^13] [^14]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) presumed that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and the baby might've been visiting with another apartment in the complex, which wasn't something unusual, or that they might've gone to the park - he wasn't worried.[^15]   
  
When the afternoon progressed into the early evening, and with [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) still nowhere to be seen, [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) realised that if [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) didn't have her car - which was still parked in the parking lot - she wouldn't be able to go pick up their [six year old child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#) from his after-school activities as she usually would, and so [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) decided to head on over to the school.[^16]   
  
He thought that maybe [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had got a lift there, or was with one of the other mums, and that he'd be able to meet her there, pick her up, and make sure everything was okay.[^17]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) arrived at [Cowan Elementary](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Cowan-Elementary.md#.md#) at about 5:50pm, collected the couple's [six year old child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#.md#), and waited.[^20]   
  
Maybe [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had been delayed, maybe she was running late, but by the time 6pm came and went, [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) had still not arrived to pick up their son.[^19]   
  
Now it is important to note that some accounts state that [Cowan Elementary](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Cowan-Elementary.md#.md#.md#) actually phoned up [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) to tell him that his [six year old child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#) hadn't been picked up from school yet but later reports suggest that not to have been the case. [^18]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#), after [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) failed to show up, decided to take their [six year old child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) back to the apartment thinking that maybe [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had returned there.[^21]   
  
But, when he got back, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and their baby was still nowhere to be seen.[^22]   
  
He settled their [six year old child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in the house, and popped out to the parking lot to see if there had been any suggestion as to where [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had gone in her car.[^23]   
  
He cautiously approached the car and pulled on the handle of the driver's door to find the vehicle to have been left unlocked - something that was very unusual.[^24]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) immediately noticed [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s red purse within the car, which still contained her wallet.[^25] [^26]   
  
All of her personal items, cash, credit cards, debit cards, and identification had been left untouched inside the purse.[^27]   
  
Now it is important to note that the couple's [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had suffered with jaundice following the birth, and so when they were discharged from the hospital, they had to supplement breast milk with formula to combat the jaundice.[^28]   
  
And to [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#)'s horror, all of the necessities needed for looking after the [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had remained within the apartment or in the vehicle; the diapers, the formula, clothing, wipes, bedding, the child seat for the car.[^29]   
  
And as we know, all apparent forms of financial means for [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had been left within her wallet, which in turn had been left in her car.[^30]   
  
There were only two items missing: [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s [iPhone 11](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Heidi-Cell-Phone.md#) and her set of [keys](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Heidi-Keys.md#).[^31]   
  
True panic set in for [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) as he began to ring up his friends and family in the area - desperate to find [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and their [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), though, nobody had any idea as to where they were.[^32]   
  
And so, at approximately 7:31pm, [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) called the Austin Police Department to report [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) and their newborn baby as missing.[^33]   
  
The responding officers conducted a deliberate search of the area surrounding the [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#), contacted members of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s family and friend group, conducted a reverse 911, calling over 4,000 residences in the immediate area of the [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#.md#), and released the names and images of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and the [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to the media.[^34]   
  
Though, as that December Thursday came to an end, [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) and her baby's whereabouts remained a mystery. [^35]   
  
The following day, on [Friday December 13th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-13-Friday-December-13-2019.md#), [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) provided his first initial statement to Austin Police Detectives [Brad Herries](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Herries.md#) and [Ryan Metcalf](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Metcalf.md#) at the Austin Police Department South Substation.[^36]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) was eager to cooperate, with the conversation being voluntary and recorded.[^37] [^38]   
  
Following the interview, [Detective Herries](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Herries.md#.md#) began to investigate [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#)'s cell phone number, which had been provided by [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#), and learnt that the number had been registered to [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) and had been on the T-Mobile network.[^39] [^40] [^41]   
  
[Detective Herries](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Herries.md#.md#) contacted T-Mobile who confirmed that they provided service for the number, and that the cell phone was currently showing to be on and active.[^42]   
  
The fact the cell phone was active kicked [Detective Herries](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Herries.md#.md#) straight into action.  (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
The detective presented a Surveillance Order with an Emergent Addendum to Travis County District Court [Judge J. Kocurek](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/01-Judge-Kocurek.md#) who reviewed the Order and approved it.[^43] [^44]   
  
This Order would allow the authorities to conduct an emergency ping for [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#)'s phone number, which they started at approximately 4:56pm on that December Friday.[^45]   
  
They hoped that this continuous ping would help them ascertain locational data associated with the use of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s cell phone, with the data updated and sent at fifteen minute intervals over the course of a 48 hour period.[^46] [^47]   
  
The following day, [Saturday December 14th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-14-Saturday-December-14th-2019.md#), the Austin Police launched a helicopter that circled the area of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#)'s apartment to aid in the search, with K9 units being deployed by Game Wardens.[^48]   
  
It had been on that Saturday that [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) made his first public plea for information pertaining to the whereabouts of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and their newborn baby.[^49]

[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s Mother also spoke with the press that day, and indicated that there wasn't anything wrong with [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) leading up to her disappearance, and that she couldn't think of anyone who might want to hurt her daughter.[^50]   
  
And later on that day, [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) spoke to the press again (though this time over the phone), here's an extract from the transcript of that conversation:[^51]   
  
>[!quote] [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)

[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) had met [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) back in 2009, and the couple had been engaged since November of 2012.[^53]   
  
[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) Elizabeth [Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) had been born in Lake Charles, Louisiana,  on the 4th of June 1986.[^54]   
  
Although she lived most of her life in Lake Charles, she did spend her early childhood years in Cameron and the past four years in Austin.[^55] [^56]   
  
Some reports suggest that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had also lived in Kyle, Texas, at some point with [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) but it's unclear when that had been.[^57]   
  
But what we do know is that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had graduated in 2004 from LaGrange High School and had studied to be a veterinary technician in college.[^58] [^59]   
  
You see, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had a massive soft spot for animals and, at the time of her disappearance, had been applying to further her education to work as a Veterinary Technician - working for the past four years at Cracker Barrel to help pay the bills.[^60] [^61]   
  
[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) was described as somebody who loved listening to music, sing, and dancing, and that her laughter brightened the day and her heart and guidance lifted countless many.[^62] [^63]   
  
Even as a child, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) was described as the welcoming friend, the neighbourhood "herd of kids" place to gather. [^66]   
  
She was remembered as having a servant's heart, and that everyone had been her "best friend" - ensuring that others had what they needed.[^64] [^65]   
  
She was adventurous and willing to try anything once, and had an overwhelming faith in the Lord and "saw God as Love"[^67]   
  
Let's take a listen to one of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s friends describe her:

When she was younger, she had been an active member of Abundant Life Fellowship, church camp and youth camp.[^68]   
  
And it had been at church camp that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#), at 11 years old, had met the her person - the person who would be her lifelong best friend, [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#).[^69]   
  
They had quickly become the best of friends after attending the Texas Bible Institute in Columbus, Texas - speaking over the phone regularly.[^70]   
  
And in 2019, in a happy coincidence, both [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) and [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) became pregnant at around the same time - expecting to bring their children into the world in late 2019. [^71] [^72]   
  
The best friends had even discussed the possibility of delivering on the same date - they really were each other's person, and supported one another through everything.[^73]   
  
And in the early hours of the morning of [Monday November 25th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-11-25-Monday-November-25th-2019.md#), [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#)'s water broke.[^74]   
  
[Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) rushed to St. David's South Austin Hospital in anticipation of the childbirth.[^75]   
  
The couple were quick to tell [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s best friend [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#) that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had gone into labour.  
  
And when [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) heard the wonderful news, she decided to drive from her home in Houston Texas to South Austin.[^76]   
  
That afternoon, [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had given [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) a key to their [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#.md#.md#) from [Heidi's keyring](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Heidi-Keys.md#.md#) so that she could use their apartment as a base.[^77]   
  
[Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) made it in time to be in the room when [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) delivered her baby, who we're calling the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in this coverage to protect the child's privacy.[^78] [^79] [^80]   
  
Also in the delivery room had been [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [V.S](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-VS.md#) - [V.S](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-VS.md#) being one of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s friends who has had their name abbreviated for the purposes of privacy protection.[^81] [^82]   
  
[Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) made sure to be there for her best friend, and even helped out after [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) was discharged from the hospital.  
  
And this love and care for her best friend only amplified after [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) went missing.  
  
Tim Miller from Eqqusearch had called up a number of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s friends after she went missing, including [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#), and this is what she told him.

And she answered the phone, and I told her who I was, and she said yeah I've seen you on TV so many times and just thank you for helping find my friend, and I said well Magen, I said what's your heart telling you on this. And she's like, Shane did it. She says I was there 10 years ago when they met, I told Heidi stay away from this guy, he's trouble relationships on and off, there's been a lot of abuse going on, Shane keeps saying well that baby's not even mine and stuff, she called me back in May and said that her and Shane had a terrible fight, and and and she just went on and on and on and to the point that literally 45 minutes later, I said Magen, listen, I got it I got to go I'm getting a call on the other line. And said Mr. Miller thank you for what you're doing, she says I'm going to keep talking to people and everything if I come up with anything, is it okay if I call you? And I said Magen please do. Please call me. And I mean looking back at that conversation on Sunday to now, there was not one single indication that I would ever believe she had anything to do with it. So you know and she's at the hospital with Heidi when she has the baby, here she is after Heidi gets out at the house helping and everything"

Thirteen days after [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had given birth, on either [Sunday December 8th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-12-08-Sunday-December-8th-2019.md#) or [Monday December 9th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-12-09-Monday-December-9th-2019.md#), almost as she had planned with [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#), [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) gave birth to a baby girl.[^83]   
  
The best friends had been in the journey of raising their newly-borns together.  (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
Which only made the sudden disappearance of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) that much more painful for all those who knew her.  (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
By the time the afternoon of [Sunday December 15th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-15-Sunday-December-15-2019.md#) came around, the continuous 48 hour ping had come to an end and it unfortunately provided no locational data for [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s cell phone, which indicated that the phone had not been in use during that time period.[^52]  
  
That same day, [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) made another emotional plea in the press.[^84]

On [Monday December 16th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-16-Monday-December-16th-2019.md#), [Shane Carey's Father](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Shane-Careys-Father.md#) told the press that he had setup a Facebook page the day before in an effort to raise money for a reward and for "expenses incurred during the search".[^85]   
  
As news of the Facebook page was published, the FBI and Texas Rangers joined the search efforts for [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and her [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^86]   
  
The investigators were attempting to remain neutral and had been trying to avoid jumping to any conclusions as they explored two possible angles: the first being that [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) had left on her own accord, and the second that [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) and her [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been the victims of foul-play.[^87] [^88]   
  
Investigators interviewed the neighbours in the complex where [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) lived, and completed an analysis of the [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#) for any potential forensic evidence, but they couldn't find any information that could answer their questions.[^89] [^90] [^91]   
  
An interview with [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in which his father had been present by the press was also published, let's take a look at [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#)'s account of what happened.

The next day, on [Tuesday December 17th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-17-Tuesday-December-17th-2019.md#), search parties were organised that included a group who had planed to use a drone to assist in the search.[^92]   
  
Meanwhile, detectives obtained surveillance footage from any premises in the area around the complex, as the FBI performed inspections of the cars.[^93] [^94]   
  
The investigators addressed the press that evening, let's take a look.[^95]

Now that Wednesday, an account from one of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s friends was published that began to paint a concerning picture.[^97]   
  
According to this friend, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had told this friend that she wanted to move to a vacant home in Kyle, Texas, that belonged to [Shane Carey's Father](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Shane-Careys-Father.md#.md#).[^98]   
  
The friend said that she had no idea that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) hadn't moved to the home, and that the friend had been surprised to hear that she had still been living in the Austin [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^99]   
  
This friend proceeded to add that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had planned to drive her son 40 minutes each way to a school in Austin so that the [six year old child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) could stay in school.[^100]   
  
>[!quote] [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s friend  
>*“She was willing to drive 40 minutes out of her way to have them in a better school. That’s not a mother that leaves…..I feel like everybody is focusing on her running away and knowing Heidi I doubt that.”*  
  
[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s friend also revealed that she had been surprised when [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had told her over the summer that she had gotten back together with [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#), as the pair had apparently previously broken up.[^101]   
  
On top of that, the friend stated that [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s recent behaviour after [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had disappeared differed from how he would previously act, when [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) allegedly showed up to her house almost immediately after [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) didn't answer the phone.[^102]   
  
>[!quote] [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s friend  
>*“Why would that not scare you as a husband? I specifically remember a time she ([Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)) was at my house and didn’t answer her phone. He ([Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)) showed up to my house freaking out right after he got home.”*   
  
And this friend hadn't been the only person to have doubts about [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#)'s version of events.

>>"The family called us first and then I called and talked to the detectives up in Austin and we talked several times with detectives, and they said we just don't have anything yet on the investigation, it's narrowing this thing down to an area that we think we need to search. And he asked me, said have you found any areas? And I said, well, I did but I don't know if they make any sense. I said, I rode around with Shane for a long time. I you know I spent a good part of the day with him and you know we hate to go up there and spend a lot of money and burn up a bunch of resources with just shooting a arrow in the sky wherever it comes down, that's where we start. So we stayed in close touch, I talked to Shane almost every day. Shane's frustrated at best"

>>"He took a lot of heat, and Shane would call me and say man they brought me and they polygraphed me, they kept me seven and a half hours and stuff, and he got upset with them, he called them some names that we can't say, and he said if I had anything do with this, squeeze it out of me. How come they can't squeeze it out of me? And you know, and Shane was questionable in my mind. He was. And his stories weren't just quite as consistent as I thought"  
  
It also emerged that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had repeatedly tried to leave [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#), and had accused him of physically assaulting her.[^103]   
  
Photos taken by [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) in March of 2019 show injuries that she had apparently sustained after [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) had attacked her in a row over her wanting to leave him.[^104]   
  
Bruises to her arms and legs can be seen in the images, which she sent to her friend.[^105]   
  
Now something of note that [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) revealed of his actions when he first realised that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had been missing had been that he had walked around the [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) complex "going through dumpsters" to see if he could find her keys.[^106]

It had been on that same December Wednesday, the 18th in 2019, that an adult female - known only as [M.W](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-MW.md#) - contacted [Detective Mireles](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-Detective-Mireles.md#) and [Detective Briegel](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/09-Detective-Briegel.md#) about an encounter she had on [December 12th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2019-12-12-Thursday-December-12-2019.md#) - the day [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and the [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) went missing.[^107]   
  
[M.W](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-MW.md#) told the detectives that on either [December 12th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2019-12-12-Thursday-December-12-2019.md#.md#) or [December 11 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-12-11-Wednesday-December-11th-2019.md#), she had been driving through the rear of the apartment complex where [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) had lived when she saw a four door vehicle, which she said had been light in colour, stopped in the parking lot perpendicular to the provider parking space.[^108] [^109]   
  
[M.W](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-MW.md#) explained that she saw a white adult female walk from between buildings 7 and 8 towards the vehicle carrying a small infant who had been wearing a knit cap.[^110] [^111]   
  
This witness saw a female exit the front passenger seat and greet the woman carrying the small infant, before opening the rear passenger side door of the car.[^112] [^114]   
  
The woman with the baby entered the rear passenger seat, both of the doors to the car closed, and the vehicle drove away.[^115]   
  
[M.W](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-MW.md#) claimed that there had not been enough time for the adult female to secure the infant into any type of child restraint system prior to the car driving away.[^113]   
  
[M.W](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-MW.md#) turned from the main lane of the parking lot and last saw the car driving towards the exit gate to South First.[^116]   
  
Now [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) had previously spoken with the investigators about [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s circle of friends, and had mentioned how [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) had been her best friend - giving them the contact details of her.[^117]   
  
The police investigated all avenues, and learnt that [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s cell phone had been serviced by T-Mobile.[^118]   
  
That same day, [Intelligence Analyst Ferguson](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/11-Intelligence-Analyst-Ferguson.md#) of the FBI conducted what is known as open source research in connection to any social media presence for [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^119]   
  
A search of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s contacts on Instagram revealed an Instagram account for the user "maygenhumphrey", and after [Intelligence Analyst Ferguson](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/11-Intelligence-Analyst-Ferguson.md#) obtained the records for that Instagram account via a Voluntary Emergency Disclosure, they learnt that the account had been registered using an email containing the name [Maygen Humphrey](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), and that it had been active for an extended period time with no post history.[^120] [^121] [^122] [^123]   
  
Further research into [Maygen Humphrey](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#) revealed at least one photo on [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s Facebook account of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) with a white female who was tagged as [Maygen Humphrey](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^124]   
  
And when they compared this white female with the known Texas Driver's License photo of [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#), they were a match.[^125]   
  
[Intelligence Analyst Ferguson](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/11-Intelligence-Analyst-Ferguson.md#) then proceeded to request records from Google pertaining to the email address used to create the [Maygen Humphrey](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) Instagram account via another Voluntary Emergency Disclosure - and this request revealed some concerning results.[^126]   
  
The search history showed a Google search for "reasons for Amber Alert" performed on [December 12th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2019-12-12-Thursday-December-12-2019.md#.md#.md#), at 10:31pm.[^127]   
  
It must be noted that to date, an official Amber Alert for the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) has not been released via Austin Police Department or Texas Department of Public Safety.[^128]   
  
Another Google search had been made at 10:42pm for "Amber alert issued Austin".[^129]   
  
And a full review of the searches performed between [November 11 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-11-11-Monday-November-11th-2019.md#) and [December 18th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-12-18-Wednesday-December-18th-2019.md#.md#) revealed some form of "[Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#)" was searched at least 162 times from a device utilizing that email account.[^130]   
  
On [December 14 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-14-Saturday-December-14th-2019.md#.md#), the Google search history showed a search for "bodies found in Austin Texas".[^131]   
  
A follow-up request via Voluntary Emergency Disclosure for any Facebook or Instagram accounts connected to the email address resulted in the identification of a Facebook account with the vanity name MAYGEN.HUMPHREY.[^132]   
  
And what was interesting about that Facebook account was that it had been active from 2008 up until 9:09pm on [December 17th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-17-Tuesday-December-17th-2019.md#.md#) when it was terminated or deactivated, and it's IP address history resolved to T-Mobile.[^133] [^134]   
  
[Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) and [Shane Carey's Father](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Shane-Careys-Father.md#.md#.md#) also provided an account from the day that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) gave birth to the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) that concerned the investigators.  
  
According to them, after the birth, multiple family members entered the delivery room.[^135]   
  
The [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was first held by [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#), then by [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#), then by [V.S](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-VS.md#.md#), and then by [Shane Carey's Father](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Shane-Careys-Father.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^136]   
  
And immediately after [Shane Carey's Father](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Shane-Careys-Father.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was handed his grandchild, [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) interjected herself and asked to hold the [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) as she needed to leave.[^137]   
  
This surprised [Shane Carey's Father](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Shane-Careys-Father.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) that his first introduction and time with his grandchild had been so rudely interrupted by a friend of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s.[^138]   
  
The key that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) had given to [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) to get access to their [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) around the time of the birth of the [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) could not be located again, and had also gone missing, even after [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) had told them that she would leave the key on the counter inside the apartment.[^139] [^140]   
  
And the fact that a heavily pregnant [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) had driven so far to a different city, stayed in the hospital no more than one hour after [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had given birth before returning to [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#)'s apartment, where she stayed until [November 27th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-11-27-Wednesday-November-27th-2019.md#) stuck out to the investigators.[^141]   
  
Further, nobody had seen any photos of the baby girl that [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) had apparently given birth to.[^142] [^142]   
  
Video footage also emerged that had been captured on exterior cameras of a residence in the same complex as [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) and [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s apartment showed a light coloured four door vehicle with the outline, window placement, and general appearance consistent with [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s 2015 [Nissan](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Magen-Nissan.md#) driving northbound towards the rear of the complex at approximately 9:05am on [Thursday December 12th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2019-12-12-Thursday-December-12-2019.md#.md#.md#.md#) - the day that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) went missing - and crucially, [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#)'s apartment had been located at the rear of the complex in that same direction.[^145] [^146]   
  
The FBI uncovered the address of [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house, and had learnt that her boyfriend [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#) also resided there.[^143] [^144]   
  
Members of the FBI Behavioural Unit had been included on numerous investigative briefs and summaries related to the disappearance of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and her [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^147]   
  
And they concluded that the totality of the interactions and events related to [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#), including traveling to another city late into a pregnancy, the interaction with [Shane Carey's Father](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Shane-Careys-Father.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) when he held his grandchild for the first time,  the image of a vehicle consistent with the vehicle operated by [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#), and the deletion of [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s Facebook account were analysed by FBI Behavioural Unit Members, who advised the investigators that the situations and scenarios described could be indicative of a female perpetrator of child abduction.[^148]   
  
On [Thursday December 19th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-19-Thursday-December-19th-2019.md#), [M.W](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-MW.md#) was invited back to the police station and was presented with a photo line-up that had been prepared by [Detective Mireles](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-Detective-Mireles.md#.md#) that featured six images of females all of a similar complexion (with no one standing out), one of which being [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#).[^149] [^150]   
  
The line-up was presented to [M.W](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-MW.md#) by [Detective Mitchell](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/10-Detective-Mitchell.md#), and when [M.W](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-MW.md#) saw the photo of [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#), she stated that she was 60-70% sure that the photo was that of the female she had seen in the front seat of the vehicle in her account.[^151] [^152]   
  
That same day, missing poster flyers that had been put up were published on social media, and two close friends of [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) told the press that they'd informed the authorities that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) wouldn't have gone off on her own.[^153] [^154] [^155]   
  
>[!quote]   
>"[Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) would have never left without her son"  
  
A search warrant for Call Detail Records associated with [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#)'s cell phone number was prepared and presented to Travis County District Court [Judge Urrutia](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-Judge-Urrutia.md#), who signed the warrant.[^156] [^157]   
  
It was submitted to T-Mobile who provided the historical locational data for the phone number associated with [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s cell phone.[^158]   
  
This data showed the device had traveled from Houston to the Austin area on [November 26th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-11-26-Tuesday-November-26th-2019.md#), which was consistent with the statements that had placed her at the hospital for the birth of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^159]   
  
The data also showed the device in the Austin area on [November 26th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-11-26-Tuesday-November-26th-2019.md#) and [November 27th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/2019-11-27-Wednesday-November-27th-2019.md#.md#).[^160]   
  
[Supervisory Special Agent Mullen](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/12-Supervisory-Special-Agent-Mullen.md#) of the FBI conducted a preliminary historical analysis of the data provided by T-Mobile had discovered that the device had been located in the Austin area near [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) on [December 12th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2019-12-12-Thursday-December-12-2019.md#.md#.md#) - the very same day that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and her [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) disappeared.[^161] [^162]   
  
The investigators jumped into action, with FBI Agents and Texas Department of Public Safety Investigators conducting surveillance of [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#)'s residence that same [Thursday December 19th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-19-Thursday-December-19th-2019.md#).[^163]   
  
The Texas Department of Public Safety deployed a helicopter for aerial observation, and the operator observed a vehicle parked in the back yard of [Magen's House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Magen-House.md#) between the garage and the building - parked in a manner consistent with an attempt to conceal it from public view, and that vehicle was confirmed to have been a gray 2015 [Nissan](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Magen-Nissan.md#.md#) Versa.[^164] [^165] [^166] [^167]   
  
FBI Agents reported that [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) had left the residence in a black Nissan Amada SUV that day, and had driven to a Target store where he was observed shopping for baby clothes and purchasing baby formula.[^168] [^169] [^170]   
  
As [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) left the Target, the Texas DPS Investigators spoke with him.[^171]   
  
[Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) informed them that he had been in a relationship with [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) since 2016, and confirmed that they had lived together at [Magen's House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Magen-House.md#).[^172] [^173]   
  
He revealed that he and [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) had actually broken up in March of 2019, though, they both had remained living in [Magen's House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Magen-House.md#).[^174]   
  
Christopher explained that in the spring of 2019, [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) told him that she had been pregnant and that he noticed [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s stomach grow during the year.[^175] [^176]   
  
He indicated that he had felt her stomach, which he described as being hard.[^177]   
[Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) stated that he never saw [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s bare stomach during the pregnancy, as their relationship during the year did not lend itself to seeing her in stages of undress, but that he believed that [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been pregnant with his child.[^178] [^179]   
  
[Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) was then showed a flyer produced by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that featured images of [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) and her [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), and when he looked at the flyer, looked at the picture of [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#)'s [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) on the flyer, he exclaimed:[^180] [^181]   
  
>[!quote] [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) to [Ranger Rainwater](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/14-Texas-Ranger-Rainwater.md#)   
>"That's the baby at my house."  
  
FBI Agents were notified of this conversation with [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#), and of the purchase of baby formula.[^182]   
  
The agents and DPS Investigators then watched as [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) walked out of the front door of her house with a cell phone and a baby monitor at about 8:15pm on [Thursday December 19th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-19-Thursday-December-19th-2019.md#).[^183]   
  
The investigators spoke with [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#), who told them that on [Thursday December 12th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2019-12-12-Thursday-December-12-2019.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) - when [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) went missing, she had left to go to the beach with a cousin while [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) had stayed in the house working.[^184]   
  
When [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) saw [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) next on [Friday December 13th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-13-Friday-December-13-2019.md#), she told [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#):[^185]   
  
>[!quote] [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) to [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#)   
>"Don't be mad, don't be mad."  
  
[Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) asked why he would be mad, to which [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) told him that there was a baby on the bed and that she had gone into labour and delivered their baby without [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#)'s knowledge.[^186] [^187] [^188]   
  
[Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) told the DPS Investigators that she had gone into labour on [Thursday December 12th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2019-12-12-Thursday-December-12-2019.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), and had gone to a birthing center in The Woodlands.[^189] [^190]   
  
A birthing center which she couldn't remember the name of.[^191]   
  
She claimed that the only people present during the delivery had been employees of the birthing center, and that she had brought the baby home that same day on [Thursday December 12th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2019-12-12-Thursday-December-12-2019.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^192]   
  
The investigators confronted [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) about the discrepancy about her location on the date she reportedly delivered, to which [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) stated that she hadn't been in Austin that day (despite the cell phone locational records and witness accounts proving differently).[^193]   
  
Members of the FBI Behavioural Analysis Unit provided an assessment of Maternal Desire, specifically, that mothers that have lost a pregnancy or that have falsified pregnancy can materialise the desire to have a child by taking possession of another child.[^194]   
  
Now as we know, [Shane](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#) had reported that the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had suffered from jaundice when discharged from the hospital, and a physician consulted by the FBI advised that untreated severe jaundice can cause a condition called kernicterus - which is a type of brain damage.[^195] [^196]   
  
[Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) had been purchasing formula, which [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had explained was necessary to treat the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s jaundice.[^197]   
  
Due to the unknown wellbeing and treatment of the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s jaundice, which could lead to brain damage if untreated, members of the Texas Department of Public Safety approached [Magen's House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Magen-House.md#) to check on the welfare of the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^198]   
  
DPS Troopers secured vehicles at the residence, and secured the perimeter of the residence.[^199]   
  
They entered [Magen's House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Magen-House.md#) in an attempt to ensure the safety of the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^200]   
  
And in a swing in the backyard, they located a young, infant child whose appearance had been consistent with that of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^201]   
  
[Texas Ranger Gary Phillips](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/15-Texas-Ranger-Gary-Phillips.md#) approached the 2015 [Nissan](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Magen-Nissan.md#.md#.md#) Versa that had been seen parked on the back porch of the residence, a vehicle that was registered to [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#).[^202]   
  
Now it's important to note that [Ranger Phillips](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/15-Texas-Ranger-Gary-Phillips.md#.md#) had investigated numerous deceased persons and had been around numerous deceased human bodies, and through his training and experience, can readily identify the odour of decomposing flesh.[^203]   
  
[Ranger Phillips](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/15-Texas-Ranger-Gary-Phillips.md#.md#) smelled the immediate and unmistakable odour of decomposing flesh coming from the trunk area of the 2015 [Nissan](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Magen-Nissan.md#.md#.md#.md#) Versa.[^204]   
  
[Detective Herries](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Herries.md#.md#) presented a search warrant for a search of the 2015 [Nissan](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Magen-Nissan.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) Versa to [Judge Urrutia](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-Judge-Urrutia.md#.md#), who approved it.[^205] [^206]   
  
[Ranger Phillips](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/15-Texas-Ranger-Gary-Phillips.md#.md#), who had still been on the scene, was notified of the signed search warrant and subsequently executed it.[^207]   
  
And during the execution of the search warrant, [Ranger Phillips](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/15-Texas-Ranger-Gary-Phillips.md#.md#) discovered a human corpse in the trunk of the vehicle.[^208]   
  
The remains were that of a female with long hair that had been shoved into a black duffle bag.[^209] [^210]   
  
[Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) was arrested after the discovery of the remains, with an order to seal the arrest warrant for a period of 30 days being filed immediately.[^211]   
  
An ambulance took the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to the hospital to be checked out as a precaution, and thankfully the baby did not have any signs of injuries.[^212]   
  
The following day, on [Friday December 20th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-20-Friday-December-20th-2019.md#), the authorities wrapped up their investigations at [Magen's House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Magen-House.md#) in the early hours of the morning at about 1:30am.[^213]   
  
[Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) was charged with two counts of kidnapping and one count of tampering with evidence on a human corpse, with her bond being set at $600,000.[^214]  
  
These charges, though, were expected to be upgraded as the evidence against [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) was collected and processed. [^215]   
  
That morning, [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) actually appeared in court for multiple previous charges related to six traffic tickets from April 2018 that included expired registration, no driver's license on demand, driving while license invalid, failure to report change of address or name, expired driver's license and no insurance.[^216] [^217]   
  
[Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) pled no contest to all six tickets and was found guilty, being fined $50 each for four of her outstanding tickets, and $175 for the remaining two.[^218] [^219]   
  
The [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), after being discharged from the hospital after the precautionary checkups, was placed in a foster home while the investigators worked to verify possible relatives of the child.[^220]   
  
A longtime friend of both [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) revealed that she had been in contact with [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) every day since [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had gone missing, speaking multiple times a day, and during those calls, she could hear a baby in the background.[^221] [^222]   
  
This friend said that [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) had told her friends and family that she had also recently given birth to a baby who she named Luna Mae, but that she wouldn't show anyone any pictures of her.[^223]   
  
Eerily, [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#)'s car remained parked outside the [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/01-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) complex, with a sticker affixed for her [Six Year Old Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#), and a shopping list visible inside that included socks and a stocking for her [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and shirts for her [Six Year Old Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Six-Year-Old-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^224] [^225]   
  
Neighbours and friends of [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) and [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) spoke to the media that day about the family, with one neighbour to the family saying that their kids played together and that the family was as "regular as you can get" and happy together - calling the entire situation "tragic".[^226] [^227] [^228]   
  
Another neighbour shared that he used to share cigarettes with [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#), and that she was always sweet and happy - "it sends a chill through my body"[^229] [^230]   
  
A nurse that works at the complex said that she used to talk to [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) regularly on the stairs, and that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) had always been "happy and chatty". [^231]   
  
The investigators then held a press conference in which they confirmed that a baby had been recovered and that DNA testing was underway to confirm that it was the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), though results could take 48-72 hours.[^232] [^233] [^234]   
  
Further, they said that they do believe that the body found had been that of [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#) but they were awaiting the results of the autopsy.[^235]   
  
Finally, they said that they were not identifying the suspect arrest in the case yet, though, the press had already discovered who had been arrested due to the arrest records.[^236]   
  
They re-affirmed that [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was not implicated.[^237]   
  
Lawyer Jackie Wood was appointed to represent [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) in the case.[^238]   
  
The Harris County Medical Examiner's Office then revealed that the body recovered had been that of [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#), and that her cause of death was ligature strangulation with the manner of death being ruled a homicide.[^239]   
  
It quickly became clear that [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) had faked her own pregnancy, and officials believed that [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) had been plotting to take the baby from [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#), leading up to the birth of the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^240] [^241]   
On [Saturday December 21st 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-21-Saturday-December-21st-2019.md#), [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) was transported from Harris County Jail back to Austin to face charges connected to [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s case. [^242]   
  
Friends of [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) spoke to the press that Saturday and said that [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been calling people, and had expressed that she had been willing to do interviews to help find [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) after she had gone missing.[^243]   
  
On Monday December 23rd 2019, the day before Christmas Eve, the [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was confirmed to have been [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s and was returned to his care.[^244]   
  
And on [Tuesday December 24th 2019](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2019-12-24-Tuesday-December-24th-2019.md#), [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) had her first appearance in front of a judge in Travis County.[^245]   
  
The arrest warrants and affidavits were then unsealed on [Thursday January 2nd 2020](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2020-01-02-Thursday-January-2nd-2020.md#), with [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) being indicted on a charge of capital murder by terror threat on [Tuesday January 28th 2020](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2020-1-28-Tuesday-January-28th-2020.md#).[^246] [^247]   
  
It was revealed that [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) had caused [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s death by asphyxiating her with a ligature, a leash and her hands.[^248]   
  
[Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s bond was set at $1,000,000 for Capital Murder and $100,000 on the Kidnapping charges.[^249]   
Two years later, after the case against [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) was fully built, on [Thursday March 10th 2022](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2022-3-10-Thursday-March-10th-2022.md#), a hearing commenced in which the defense attorneys for [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) claimed that the police didn't have a search warrant when the [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s body were found at [Magen's House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Magen-House.md#), and requested that evidence be thrown out.[^250]   
  
During the morning's portion of the hearing, [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s defense claimed that Texas Rangers didn't have probably cause to enter the home at 1:17pm when they did, and that the warrant that would've granted them entry wasn't issued until later that day at 8:30pm.[^251] [^252]   
  
The burden was then shifted to the state to establish if there had been probable cause to enter the home without a search warrant, with the state citing three exceptions that justified it: [^253] [^254]   
  
1. Law enforcement isn't required to show probably cause when action is immediately necessary to protect a human life.[^255]   
2. There was an objective standard of reasonableness to enter, given the facts and circumstances of the case, and;[^256]   
3. Consent was given by someone authorised to provide consent, allowing Texas Rangers to enter the home without a warrant.[^257]   
  
The lead detective on the case explained to the court how [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) had become a person of interest after speaking with [Shane Carey](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/01-Shane-Carey.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), who had told them that a friend of [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s had a pregnancy at around the same time, but that there hadn't been any pictures of the baby.[^258]   
  
And that a search for [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s Facebook page had revealed it to have been deleted, which the detective found to be unusual given the timing.[^259]   
  
The detective explained that he had gone to the hospital where [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#)'s baby had been born and had spoken with the nurses that had told him they remembered [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) being there and wanting to hold the baby before the actual family could.[^260]   
  
The court then heard of how Texas Rangers had stopped [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) who had been buying baby products.[^261]   
  
And how he had explained that he had previously been in a relationship with [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#), but that they still lived together.[^262]   
  
The court heard how [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) had gotten home with their newborn baby on the very same day that [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#) and her baby had gone missing in Austin.[^263]   
  
It was explained how [Christopher Green](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Christopher-Green.md#.md#.md#) confirmed that the picture of the missing baby on the flyer had been the same baby that was in [Magen's House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Magen-House.md#).[^264]   
  
One of the two Texas Rangers testified that they did a "protective sweep" of [Magen's House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Magen-House.md#) to find the baby, and once the baby was found safe, he had ordered everyone to exit the home as they didn't have a search warrant.[^265] [^266]   
  
Further, the Texas Ranger stated that they had noticed the smell of a decomposing body and had traced it to the car but didn't search or seize anything until the search warrant was obtained later that day.[^267]   
  
The court heard how it was only until after the search warrant was issued that the Rangers located the body in the trunk of the car and ordered [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) to be arrested.[^268]   
  
[Detective Herries](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/01-Detective-Herries.md#.md#) also testified that they believed the newborn baby had jaundice and that based on the information he had, the situation could be life-threatening, which was one of the reasons they didn't wait for a search warrant.[^269]   
  
On [Friday March 11th 2022](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2022-3-11-Friday-March-11th-2022.md#), the Court continued to hear testimony before ruling on the motion to suppress evidence.[^270]   
  
The first witness from the state had been a trooper who had told the state he was coordinating with the FBI early on in the case and that he would later become the first member of law enforcement to make contact with the [newborn child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^271]   
  
Video evidence shown by [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s defense from an FBI surveillance plane showed that [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) had still been in the backyard when the law enforcement had arrived.[^272]   
  
The trooper said that shortly after arriving, he hopped the fence to get access to the back of the house.[^273]   
  
He told the state that he jumped the fence because [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) requested she be allowed to go back inside to meet law enforcement in the front, instead of opening a rear gate for them, saying he was worried if she went back to the baby  "she would kill it".[^274]   
  
"The reason I jumped over the fence was because there was a kidnapped baby inside the house".[^275]   
  
The next witness had been a Texas Ranger who had been the one to make first contact with [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) as law enforcement approached the home.[^276]   
  
He was also assigned to stand with [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) between the time law enforcement made contact with her until eight hours later, when someone from Austin Police Department took over.[^277]   
  
The Ranger had an audio recording device on him which recorded that roughly eight hour interaction.[^278]   
  
Each law enforcement officer testified that they rescued the child and secured the property - but waited for a search warrant before commencing any search efforts.[^279]   
  
In one officer's body camera video, a Texas Ranger can be heard telling other law enforcement officers "once it's clear everybody else get the f- out of the house because it's a crime scene".[^280]   
  
[Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s defense pointed out that they had started a crime scene log at 1:25pm that day, and that he had submitted photos to evidence that were taken in bright sunlight, though, a search warrant had not been secured until 8:53pm and the sunset in Houston had been at 5:26pm.[^281]   
  
On [Thursday May 12th 2022](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2022-5-12-Thursday-May-12th-2022.md#), the judge denied the defense team's request and ruled that [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) had voluntarily spoken with law enforcement at the home and had understood her rights.[^282]   
  
On Tuesday January 28th 2023, it was published that it was expected that [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) would enter a guilty plea during her next court appearance on January 31st, and in exchange for the plea agreement, [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#) was expecting a sentence of 55 years in prison.[^283]   
  
Though, due to a snow storm on [Tuesday January 31st 2023](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2023-1-31-Tuesday-January-31st-2023.md#), the hearing was moved to [Thursday February 2nd 2023](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2023-02-02-Thursday-February-2nd-2023.md#).[^284]   
  
And on that day, [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) pleaded guilty to murder her best friend, [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#).[^285]   
  
Travis County District Judge Selena Alvarenga sentenced her to 55 years in prison.[^286]   
  
“It is difficult, if not impossible, to find justice for this horrendous crime. You have deprived an innocent child — an innocent baby — of the opportunity of growing up with her mother,” Alvarenga said to a tearful [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#).[^287]   
  
"You have destroyed an entire family. No matter what the sentence — no matter how long, no matter how harsh — nothing can change that. Nothing can make this family whole again." [^288]   
  
 “Heidi’s hugs were strong and full of love,” Broussard’s mother said to the court. “I still feel them now.”[^289]   
  
“She loved beyond measure, and she never gave up on anyone. When I think of her – which is every moment and everything I do – I ask what would Heidi say or think. And it gives me peace.” Broussard’s mother continued. [^290]   
  
 “We miss her dearly.”[^291]   
  
 District Attorney José Garza said he felt the plea bargain was appropriate and "saved the family potentially decades of the painful post-litigation process and helped secure justice." [^292]   
  
And that brings us to the end of this case.   
  
We can only hope that [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#)'s family and friends have been able to find closure in the justice served, and that they are able to move forward with the memories of their loved one kept close to heart.

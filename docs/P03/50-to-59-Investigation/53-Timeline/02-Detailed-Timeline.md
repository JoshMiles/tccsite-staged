2. Friends of [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) spoke to the press and said that she had been calling people, and that she said she'd be willing to do interviews to help find [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#.md#).[^283] ^jzlfp  
3. It was revealed that the detectives had first called [Magen Fieramusca](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#) when [Heidi Broussard](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#.md#) went missing, and [Magen](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Magen-Rose-Fieramusca.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) said:[^284]

## [Thursday March 10th 2022](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2022-3-10-Thursday-March-10th-2022.md#)  
  
1. Hearing underway in which the defense attorneys claimed the police didn't have a search warrant when [Newborn Child](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Newborn-Child.md#.md#) and [Heidi](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Heidi-Broussard.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body was found at [Magen's House](../52-Key-Locations/03-Magen-House.md#), with the defense wanting the evidence thrown out.[^291] ^-z3lg  
2. During the morning portion of the hearing, Fieramusca’s defense requested a motion to suppress evidence on the basis that Texas Rangers entered Fieramusca’s Houston home on Dec. 19, 2019, at 1:17 p.m. without a warrant. [^292] ^lr0l0  
	1. The defense claimed Texas Rangers didn’t have probable cause to enter the home at that time. A warrant was eventually issued later that day at 8:30 p.m.  [^293] ^6vs3c  
3. The burden then shifted to the state to establish why there was probable cause to enter the home without a search warrant.  [^294] ^k-28j  
4. The state cited three exceptions justifying the search and seizure of the home at that time: [^295] ^osrz8  
	1. law enforcement isn’t required to show probable cause when action is immediately necessary to protect human life, [^296] ^8lirh  
	2. there was an objective standard of reasonableness to enter, given the facts and circumstances of the case and [^297] ^f4eyu  
	3. consent was given by someone authorized to provide consent, allowing Texas Rangers to enter the home without a warrant.  [^298] ^cf57q  
5. He _(lead detective)_ explained how Fieramusca became a person of interest after speaking with Carey, who told him at the time a friend of Broussard’s had a pregnancy around the same time, but there weren’t any pictures of the baby. A search for Fieramusca’s Facebook page found the account had been deleted, which the former detective also found to be unusual, given the timing.  [^299] ^gk80u  
6. The sergeant told the court officers went to the hospital where Broussard’s baby was born, and nurses told them they remembered Fieramusca being there and wanting to hold the child before the actual family could.  [^300] ^9-2pj  
7. Texas Rangers stopped a man, Chris Green, who was buying baby products. Green said he was previously in a relationship with Fieramusca, and they still lived together. Green stated Fieramusca had just gotten home with their newborn baby on the same day Broussard and her baby went missing in Austin, according to the sergeant. [^301] ^zqzpx  
8. When Texas Rangers showed Green a picture of the missing baby, Green confirmed that was the same baby in Fieramusca’s home.  [^302]   
9. One of two Texas Rangers who testified explained they did a “protective sweep” of the house to find the baby. [^303] ^di6uk  
	1. Once the baby was found safe, he ordered everyone to exit the home, because they didn’t have a search warrant.  [^304] ^bzvoi  
10. Further, the Texas Ranger said they noticed the smell of a decomposing body and traced it to the car but didn’t search or seize anything until the search warrant was obtained later that day. [^305] ^v-203  
	1. It was only until after the search warrant was issued did the Rangers find Broussard’s body in the trunk of the car and ordered Fieramusca to be arrested.  [^306] ^k-cpy  
11. Herries testified they believed baby Margo had jaundice and that based on the information he had, the situation could be life-threatening, one of the reasons why they didn’t wait for a search warrant.[^307] ^tyxhw

## [Friday March 11th 2022](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2022-3-11-Friday-March-11th-2022.md#)  
  
1. A judge will wait to rule on a motion to suppress evidence in the case of a woman accused of killing her best friend, Heidi Broussard, kidnapping Broussard’s newborn baby and pretending it was her own.  [^308] ^1821a  
2. The first witness from the state Friday morning was a trooper who told the state he was coordinating with the FBI early in the case and would later become the first member of law enforcement to make contact with the then-missing baby.  [^309] ^uo4oo  
3. Video shown by the defense from an FBI surveillance plane showed Fieramusca was still in the backyard when law enforcement arrived.  [^310] ^nfwju  
4. Lopez said shortly after arriving he hopped the fence to get access to the back of the house. He told the state he jumped the fence because Fieramusca requested she be allowed to go back inside to meet law enforcement in the front, instead of opening a rear gate for them, saying he was worried if she went back to the baby “she would kill it.”  [^311] ^qpbx8  
5. “The reason I jumped over the fence was because there was a kidnapped baby inside this house,” he later told the defense when they cross-examined him.  [^312] ^29592  
6. The next witness, and the witness that was left on the stand before the court broke for lunch, was Daron Parker, a Texas Ranger. Parker was one of the first to make contact with Fieramusca as law enforcement approached the Houston suburb home, he said.  [^313] ^katl6  
7. He was also assigned to stand with Fieramusca between the time law enforcement made contact with her until roughly eight hours later, when someone from the Austin Police Department took over. Parker had an audio recording device on him which recorded that roughly eight-hour interaction, he testified.  [^314] ^x0apu  
8. Closing arguments and a ruling will be made on April 28 at 9 a.m.[^315]   
9. Friday, each law enforcement officer testified that they rescued the child and secured the property – but waited for a warrant to initiate a search.  [^316] ^jri2v  
10. In Austin Police Sgt. Patrick Eastlick’s body camera video, a Texas Ranger can be heard telling other law enforcement officers "once it’s cleared everybody else get the f— out of the house because it’s a crime scene."  [^317] ^3jft4  
11. Fieramusca's defense attorneys pointed out that Texas Ranger Eric Lopez started a crime scene log at 1:25 p.m. that day. He submitted photos to evidence that were taken in bright sunlight. However, a search warrant was not secured until 8:53 p.m. Sunset in Houston was 5:26 p.m.  [^318] ^lwori

1. At a court hearing on Thursday, May 12, Judge Selena Alvarenga denied her defense team's request. They claimed that the evidence was illegally obtained when investigators entered the Harris County home without a search warrant. The judge ruled that Fieramusca voluntarily spoke with law enforcement at the home and understood her rights.[^319] ^km3xu

1. Magen Fieramusca pleaded guilty Thursday to murdering her best friend, Heidi Broussard, in 2019. Travis County District Court Judge Selena Alvarenga sentenced her to 55 years in prison.  [^323] ^5mqvd  
2. “It is difficult, if not impossible, to find justice for this horrendous crime. You have deprived an innocent child — an innocent baby — of the opportunity of growing up with her mother,” Alvarenga said to a tearful Fieramusca.  [^324] ^s0ind  
	1. "You have destroyed an entire family. No matter what the sentence — no matter how long, no matter how harsh — nothing can change that. Nothing can make this family whole again." [^328] ^hog75  
3. “Heidi’s hugs were strong and full of love,” Broussard’s mother, Tammy, said to the court. “I still feel them now.”  [^325] ^8p01y  
4. “She loved beyond measure, and she never gave up on anyone. When I think of her – which is every moment and everything I do – I ask what would Heidi say or think. And it gives me peace.” Broussard’s mother continued.  [^326] ^1lppv  
5. “We miss her dearly.”  [^327] ^r4s81  
6. Fieramusca was originally charged with capital murder. District Attorney José Garza said he felt the plea bargain was appropriate and "saved the family potentially decades of the painful post-litigation process and helped secure justice."  [^329] ^r3qws

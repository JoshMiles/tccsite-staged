# The Script  
  
### Intro  
  
In a quaint Swedish village, a love story spanning four decades meets a tragic and bewildering end.   
  
Agneta Westlund, a loving wife and mother, is found mutilated near a serene lake.   
  
The prime suspect? Her husband, Ingemar Westlund.   
  
Arrested and ostracised by his community, Ingemar claims innocence, but the evidence seems damning.   
  
Yet, as investigators dig deeper, they stumble upon clues so bizarre, they defy belief.   
  
Could the real culprit be not man, but beast?   
  
### Background  
  
[Ingemar Westlund](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md) and [Agneta Westlund](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md) met when they were teenagers, and unfortunately not all too much is known about their early childhood years.  
  
But what we do know is that when [Ingemar Westlund](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md) had been 19 years old, and [Agneta Westlund](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md) had been 15 years old, they entered into a relationship together.  
  
This relationship would blossom into a life-long lasting love that would, tragically, outlive [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md).  
  
At some point in their twenties, the couple eloped.  
  
They would go on to have two daughters together, who would later tell reporters that their father would've worshipped the ground that their mother walked on.  
  
In their later years, the two had settled on a farm in the small village of Loftahammer.  
  
[Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) and [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md) spent their days enjoying several hobbies, and tending to the land as they enjoyed growing old together.  
  
They had a fairly set routine, with a good reputation and several friends in the village overall.  
  
### Lead-Up  
  
In the later evening hours of [Friday September 8th 2008](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/2008-9-8-Friday-September-8th-2008.md), the sun still hung high enough in the sky for [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md) - who had been 68 years old by this point - and [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) - who had been 63 years old - to be outside.  
  
They had both been wrapped up in their own tasks, with [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) riding a large lawnmower to shape up the lawn, and [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) preparing to take the family dog on a walk.  
  
That evening, [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) led the dog away from the land of the farm and down towards the shoreline of a nearby lake - a common path for [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) to take.  
  
[Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) carried on mowing the lawn, not giving it a second though, it had been a perfectly ordinary evening.  
  
He did not know, though, that as he glanced over to see [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) leaving the farm they shared together, that he would never see his soulmate alive again.  
  
As [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) finished up mowing the lawn, he went back inside the family home and sat on the couch.  
  
He and [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) had been planning to watch a sports programme that night after they'd finished their outdoor activities, but it had been growing late.  
  
This was strange for [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md), as she usually didn't take so long to walk the dog.  
  
However, [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) clicked on the television and told himself that she might have just taken a longer walk than normal.  
  
[Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) would sometimes pick wild mushrooms to use in her cooking, and always kept a small bag for collecting the mushrooms with her when she went on her walks to do so.  
  
And because of this, [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) shrugged off her absence and continue to watch the television.  
  
Though, as darkness fell, [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) began to grow concerned.  
  
A long walk wouldn't have been too abnormal for [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md), but a long walk after the sun had set was very out of the ordinary.  
  
All she had with her had been her phone, a pack of cigarettes, the mushroom collection bag, and the family dog Yocke - she had nothing that would've helped her see properly in the dark.  
  
[Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) decided to call [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s mobile phone, but he received no answer.  
  
This was also very strange for [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) who always ensured to answer the phone.  
  
[Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) then tried calling up friends that lived nearby to see if she'd maybe stopped to see them on her walk, though they hadn't seen her either.  
  
And in a panic, [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) grabbed a torch and put on layers, dressing for the chilly September air outside, and set off to look for his wife [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md).  
  
### The Crime  
  
[Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) searched along the usual path that [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) would've taken to walk the dog, and called out into the darkness for her.  
  
His shouts echoed into the night, with only the sound of the wind rushing through the leaves answering his calls.  
  
He got no response, but kept searching.  
  
[Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) listened intently for any possible shouts, or even just barking from the dog, but he was unable to find any clues as to the whereabouts of his wife.  
  
It wasn't until about 10pm that night, when he searched closer to the lake, that he found his wife [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md).  
  
She had been horrifically mutilated on the beach of the lake, about 10 metres from the shoreline.  
  
Her remains had severe damage to her legs and torso, with even further damage to her face and head.  
  
It appeared that whoever had murdered her, had beaten and shredded her as much as possible in an extremely violent and brutal attack.  
  
When [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) checked for any signs of life, he tragically found none.  
  
And upon realising that there was no way he could bring her back, he immediately called for the police.  
  
### Investigation  
  
#### Immediate Investigation  
  
When the first responders arrived on the scene, they were shocked at how gruesome the crime scene had been.  
  
And due to the grizzly nature of [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s death, it was quickly determined to have been a murder.   
  
Now, as is stereotypical and arguably morally wrong to do in cases of spousal death, the investigators immediately suspected [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) as being responsible for [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s death.  
  
The initial impressions of the scene told them that this had in no way been an accident - there was no possible way for someone to accidentally die in a way so gruesome without the involvement of machinery or something to that effect.  
  
The forensics teams analysed the scene and took several samples from around the scene before [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s remains were removed and taken to the medical examiner's office to undergo an autopsy.  
  
In later interviews, [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) stated that mere hours after the death of his life-long soulmate and wife, [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md), the chief of operations left him a message saying:  
  
>[!quote] Chief of Operations  
>"As you understand, you are a suspect in the murder of your wife."  
  
[Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) was outraged and terrified by this, saying in an interview with Allas:  
  
>[!quote] [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md)  
>"How the hell can you believe that I have murdered a woman to whom I have been married for 42 years and with whom I have two children?"  
  
Despite [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md)'s devastation at the accusation that he'd been responsible, the investigation into him as the possible murderer continued.  
  
The autopsy was conducted and determined that [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) had died due to the trauma and from blood loss from the wounds she'd sustained during the attack.  
  
Specifically, the severe damage inflicted to her chest had caused severe, rapid and fatal bleeding.  
  
The autopsy revealed that in some of the wounds on [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s body had been blades of grass and chunks of random fur, as well as DNA evidence from some kind of saliva.  
  
Further, the autopsy had been unable to determine what exactly had caused the damage to [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s remains - no murder weapon could be determined.  
  
However, the authorities had a theory.  
  
The investigators theorised that it could be possible that some machine, potentially a machine like a lawnmower, could have been capable of inflicting that degree of severely violent damage.  
  
A machine just like the lawnmower that [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) had been riding that night.  
  
They speculated that it could be possible that he had run over [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) on the farm, placed her body in a trailer, moved her to the lake, and then pretended to have "found" her body there.  
  
And because of this, the authorities felt that [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) was more than likely the perpetrator of this killing.  
  
On [Saturday September 6th 2008](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2008-9-6-Saturday-September-6th-2008.md),  less than 12 hours after the murder of [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md), [Ingemar Westlund](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md) was arrested by the police on suspicion of murder.   
  
And the reaction in the local community was immediate - those who once knew and liked [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) hated him.  
  
They saw him as a monster who they believed had literally mowed over his own wife.  
  
[Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) was sent to a correctional facility as a prisoner during the course of the interrogations by the investigators, being made to go over his version of events over and over again with the investigators providing minimal information as to what they had found.  
  
The authorities spent significant time at the family farm collecting evidence from the bottom of the ride-on lawnmower that [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) had been using, as well as several other pieces of farm equipment and from a trailer at the farm.  
  
These pieces of equipment were found to all have had blood on them.  
  
Samples were subsequently taken and sent to be analysed forensically to establish if they had contained [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s DNA.  
  
A cadaver dog allegedly also made numerous signals when detecting scents around the farm.  
  
Ten days after the blood samples were sent off to be tested, the results of the DNA testing were completed.  
  
The blood was not that of [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md), in fact, the blood hadn't been human at all.  
  
[Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) was released from the correctional facility that same day, but he remained a suspect in the investigation.  
  
Following his release, [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) went to go stay with his daughters in another city as the community he once called home now hated him - he didn't want to stay there any longer.  
  
#### Continued Investigation  
  
In October of 2008, the authorities decided to experiment further with the lawnmower theory.  
  
They conducted an experiment in which they purchased half of a pig from a butcher's shop, covered it with a layer of denim fabric as to simulate the jeans that [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) had been wearing that night, and proceeded to use the lawn mower to run over the pig.  
  
When they did so, they found that the lawnmower actually sustained more damage than the pig did.  
  
They conducted this experiment several times, but found that in each experiment, the pig had not sustained the same kind of damage that [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) had during the attack.  
  
In November 2008, about two months after her death, [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s remains were finally released by the authorities to the family so that they could bury her and put her to rest.  
  
However, it's important to note that they actually sent [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s remains to the wrong place.  
  
They sent her to Västervik instead of Nacka, where her family had wanted her to go.  
  
When [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s family reached out to ask about it, they were told that they would have to pay for her remains to be moved to the proper location.  
  
About this, [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) said:  
  
>[!quote] [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md)  
>"It was like she was a form of cargo. They could have asked me or my daughters where we wanted to bury her. It was such a lack of respect."  
  
As the police continued to investigate [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) as a suspect, his wife [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) was buried at a church in Nacka.  
  
On [Monday December 15th 2008](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2008-12-15-Monday-December-15th-2008.md), [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) was taken to the family farm one more time to recreate what he had done the night his wife was murdered.  
  
He followed back on his own path, and explained to the investigators what he did, what he saw, and what he experienced that night.   
  
He'd go on to give a detailed description of what happened during that last questioning to the media and gave the investigators one last plea:  
  
>[!quote] [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md)  
>"It is like this, and it may be difficult for you to understand, but I know that I am innocent and my greatest fear is that you are now employing thirty, forty men to find evidence against me and concentrating on a completely insane theory that is technically impossible. And so that's the situation you've put me in - you're not going to solve this and I'll remain a suspect and have to live with this for the rest of my life. I have been to the tomb three times but am still labelled a murderer. It is completely incomparable."  
  
  
#### Ingemar Cleared  
  
On [Wednesday January 28th 2009](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2009-1-28-Wednesday-January-28th-2009.md), [Ingemar Westlund](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md) was finally cleared of suspicion in the murder of his wife [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md).  
  
He and his family came out and released a statement in which they said that it had been a massive relief for them that he had been cleared, but that they hope they'll get the truth soon.  
  
The investigators had still been set on the fact that [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) had been murdered, they just did not know who by.  
  
It wouldn't be until later in the year of 2009 that the family and the investigators would finally make a break in the case.  
  
As the detectives continued hunting for answers, one of the detectives stumbled upon a YouTube video from Canada in which a person was kicked to death by a moose.  
  
It's unclear whether the video had just been a discussion of the death, or if it had actually been a recorded incident.  
  
But what we do know is that this video put a major doubt into their minds - what if the person who had murdered [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) hadn't been a person after all?  
  
The investigators proceeded to reach out to the Swedish National Forensic Center, or the SKL, to find out whether there had been any animal DNA present on [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s remains.  
  
The SKL were quick to respond, and they told the investigators that there had been animal DNA found on the remains.  
  
The saliva had been that of an elf, and the fur found in the wounds had come from an elk, all of which found on [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md)'s body.  
  
On [Monday September 28th 2009](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/2009-9-28-Monday-September-28th-2009.md), over a year after her death, it was concluded that [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) had actually been trampled and killed by an elk.  
  
Now, Elk aren't known for being friendly, but the theory as to how this happened is genuinely wild: they theorised that the Elk had actually been drunk at the time of the incident.  
  
There had been numerous instances of Elks eating fermented apples that had been discarded in the cider-making process that he caused the Elks to experience a form of intoxication.  
  
And this intoxication had typically led to heightened aggression in the animals.  
  
It's important to note that there was mixed reporting to determine if this was truly the case, however, it was still reported on internationally so take it with a pinch of salt.  
  
### Outcome  
  
Despite having been cleared of any involvement in the death of his wife, many still felt that [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) had been the person behind her death.  
  
Many people in the village of Loftahammar felt that he'd lucked out of the situation and that he shouldn't be walking around a free man.  
  
Despite this view in the court of public opinion, the forensic evidence supported the theory that [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md) had been killed by a moose that night.  
  
[Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) continued to live close to his daughters after the death of [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md), with him now having six grandchildren that have since been brought into the world.  
  
He spends his time with his family, who all naturally still mourn the loss of [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md).  
  
Eventually, a book titled *"On Improbably Grounds"* was released, written by Hannes Duckler, and this book was written based on the ten or so binders of files that eventually piled up about the case.  
  
[Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) was actually interviewed for this book, and in an article after it was published he said:  
  
>[!quote] [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md)  
>"I have felt great bitterness towards the police and really wanted to write the book myself. I want to talk about how rude people behaved, but at the same time, I don't want to be a vindictive type."  
  
[Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) eventually received 24,000 Swedish Krona, or just over 1,849 GBP or just shy of $2,300, as compensation for his troubles, though, his lawyer had initially requested 621,000 Swedish Krona (47.830 gbp or just shy of $60k).  
  
When asked about the compensation, [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) said:  
  
>[!quote] [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md)  
>"It's not about the money. I would like an apology or a pardon. I have no received that."  
  
In 2021, a documentary was released about this case titled "Who Killed Agneta?" which covered both the investigator's side and the side of [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md)'s.  
  
### Conclusion  
  
Even years after the death of his wife, there are many people that still feel that [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) used the Elk story to cover up the fact that he had murdered [Agneta](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/01-Agneta-Westlund.md.md.md).  
  
However, it is vitally important to established the degree of harshness that the investigation went to which painted him out as the killer to them.  
  
For over six months, [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) had been so badly slandered by his own community that he ended up moving away, abandoning the home which he had lived in and loved for years.  
  
And although he had been cleared, the damage to his name and reputation had been irreparable.   
  
We were unable to determine whether [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) is still with us today, but we can speculate that he's still seen as a murdered in the village of Loftahammar that he used to call his home despite the official investigation's conclusion.  
  
Personally, I believe that Ingemar is indeed innocent.  
  
The presence of so much Elk DNA, the fur, and the failed lawnmower experiments are impossible to ignore - especially as there had been no damage caused to [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md)'s lawnmower.  
  
I think the only reason that so many people believe him to be guilty was due to how skewed the investigation and subsequent media coverage had been, and the fact that some people simply don't want to be wrong.  
  
Whatever the case, I hope that [Ingemar](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/01-Ingemar-Westlund.md.md.md.md.md) and his family have been able to grieve for their loss, and have been able to recover from what can only be described as a complete nightmare.  
  
And that's everything I have for you in this case.

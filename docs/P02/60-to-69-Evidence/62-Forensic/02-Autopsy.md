# Autopsy  
  
An [autopsy](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/02-Autopsy.md) was performed by Associate Medical Examiner S. Adams, MD. Dr. [^1]  
  
Adams advised that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md) suffered both blunt force and sharp force trauma to her face, forehead, and back of her head. She suffered a fractured skull to the lower left section. The Dr. estimated 19 separate blunt force and sharp force wounds on the face and head. [^1]  
  
[Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md) was observed to have contusions to both of her arms and hands that were consistent with defensive wounds. There were no sharp force wounds to any other parts of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md)'s body besides her face and head. There were no injuries to the torso and legs. The [autopsy](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/02-Autopsy.md) revealed the victim had water in her lungs and airway consistent with drowning. [^1]  
  
**Dr. Adams determined the cause of death was blunt force and sharp force trauma with a third component of asphyxiation by drowning.** [^1]  
  
The Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office conducted an [autopsy](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/02-Autopsy.md) on [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md)'s body on [Wednesday-February-13th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/04-2013-02-13-Wednesday-February-13th-2013.md). At [autopsy](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/02-Autopsy.md), the pathologist discovered [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md) had suffered multiple injuries to her head and face: 12 sharp force injuries and 10 blunt force injuries. The blunt force blows caused a skull fracture that would have caused [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md)'s death. However, it was apparent that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md) was still alive when placed in the bathtub, as the medical examiner discovered that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md) had drowned while face down in the tub. Other than a number of defensive bruises on her forearms and hands, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md) had no injuries other than the 22 blows and cuts to her head. **No evidence of sexual assault was found.**

# Footprint Analysis  
  
Here, Sgt. Massey described how she compared footprints by analyzing  
  
"the shape of the foot, the location of the tow (sic) pads, the    
specific space that each towed (sic) pad takes up, the    
distance of various tow (sic) pads to what we call the met tar    
sell (sic) ridge, or the front edge, leading edge of the balance    
ball of the foot, the width and shape of the ball of the foot, the    
widths of the arch, the heal (sic), the overall length of the foot,    
so a combination of these features is what we are looking at."

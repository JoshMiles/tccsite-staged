Police also located a plastic bag from Home Depot. Inside the bag were two unopened bags containing [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md).  
  
Police started the search of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md) shortly after completing the search of the [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md). During the course of this search, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md) consented to a taped interview in which he laid out in detail his activities of the last several days. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md) indicated he had purchased the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md) [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md) at the Home Depot located at 128th and Highway 99 in south Everett. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md) indicated he had lunch at Taco Bell.  
  
On [Sunday-October-27th-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/07-2012-10-27-Sunday-October-27th-2012.md), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md) purchased a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md), two sets of [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md), and disposable shoe covers at Home Depot.  
  
Analysis done on the bloodstain impressions present on the bathtub where [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md)'s body was located, found that the fabric on the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md) was visually similar to the bloodstain impressions, and that experimental bloodstains done in the lab with the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md) were consistent with what was found at the death scene.  
  
According to the bloodstain pattern analyst "the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md) Coverall fabric produced a patterned contact bloodstain with a limited association of some characteristics of the contact bloodstains observed at the original crime scene. This is class evidence which means that the object has characteristics common to a group of similar objects, but not one single object. And although similarities are notes; there are significant limiting factors between the questioned and known impressions.".  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md) arrived at 1:37pm, and left at 1:44pm. As described above, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md) admitted purchasing two [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md) [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md) at Home Depot at this time.

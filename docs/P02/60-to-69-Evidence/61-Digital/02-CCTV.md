A check of surveillance video ([CCTV](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/02-CCTV.md)) on the route from [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md) to [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md)'s home (1.7 miles each way) located a biker coming from the direction of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md) at 2:24am in the early morning hours of [Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md). The quality of the video is such that one can say little more than it is an individual on a [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md). A check of [traffic cameras](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/02-CCTV.md) located a biker eastbound of 240th St. make a left hand turn (northbound) onto the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md)-Everett Highway at 4:13am. This would be the most direct route from [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md)'s home to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md). Once again, the quality is such that little can be said other than that it shows a person on a [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md).  
  
The time frame that the various cameras ([CCTV](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/02-CCTV.md)) show a bicyclist on the route to and from [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md) is consistent with the time frame police believe the murder occurred. Police believe [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md) may have left his [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md) unattended and unsecured in the hopes that it would be stolen, this disposing of it as possible evidence.  
  
Police were able to confirm that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md) did in fact stop at Walmart via surveillance video ([CCTV](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/02-CCTV.md)) and receipts.

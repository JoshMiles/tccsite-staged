## Facts  
  
On [Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#), officers responded to 216 240th St SW ([The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#)) in [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#), Everett for a welfare check.  
  
[Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) had not reported to work for the past two days and her employer called law enforcement for a welfare check. When officers entered the Smith House, they found an individual, later identified as [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#), face down in the bath tub.  
  
Officers learned that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) were in the process of getting a divorce and went to meet with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) at work.

## Party at the Smith House  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) returned to Washington on [Saturday-February-9th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/19-2013-02-09-Saturday-February-9th-2013.md#) at 12:00pm.

[Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) was having a Fasching (a German version of Mardi Gras) party. A number of [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#) from the neighbourhood were present. While at the house, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) went into the kitchen, two bedrooms, the hallway, the bathroom and the living room. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) went with his son to the restroom.

When police searched [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#), they located a camera. They viewed the pictures on the camera. The pictures were of the party [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) had at [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#) on [.Saturday-February-9th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/19-2013-02-09-Saturday-February-9th-2013.md#). The pictures show the condition of the home on [Saturday-February-9th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/19-2013-02-09-Saturday-February-9th-2013.md#.md#), including the bathroom where [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) was found. ^ti2ld  
  
## Susann's Internet Activity  
  
On [Sunday-February-10th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/20-2013-02-10-Sunday-February-10th-2013.md#), [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) used her time away from the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#) to catch up with friends. She spoke to a friend from Germany on the phone. She went to Choir practice and then met up with [Ani Gothard-Williams](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Ani-Gothard-Williams.md#) to see The Music Man in Seattle. [Mrs Gothard-Williams](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/06-Ani-Gothard-Williams.md#) and [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) met up at the theatre.  
  
After the show, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) dropped Mrs. Gothard-Williams off at her home. [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) returned to [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#) sometime before 10:30pm. [Mr Buckley](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/07-Mr-Buckley.md#) returned home with his daughter at 10:30pm and saw [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) standing out in front of [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). ^cmibw  
  
[Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) came over and started talking to [Mr Buckley](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/07-Mr-Buckley.md#.md#). The conversation was quick and she returned home. ^asip5  
  
After going inside, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) did not go to bed immediately. [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) turned on her computer and access the internet. She went to BECU.com and logged into an online banking account. She went to GOOGLE.COM and then began searching on Netflix. ^uk0jj  
  
At 11:35pm, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) was still accessing Netflix. ^d42pd  
  
Law enforcement searched [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#)'s laptop and other electronic equipment. They discovered that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) was actively accessing the internet after she got home on [Sunday-February-10th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/20-2013-02-10-Sunday-February-10th-2013.md#).   
  
## Dr. Davenport Testimony & Bike Sighting  
  
Law enforcement viewed various [traffic cameras](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/02-CCTV.md#) to look for vehicles belonging to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) on the night of [Sunday-February-10th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/20-2013-02-10-Sunday-February-10th-2013.md#) or early morning of [Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#).    
While they did not see any vehicles that matched the description of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s vehicles, they did notice what appeared to be a [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#) traveling in the early morning hours of [Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#.md#).    
In the same images that showed the bike, a Pete's coffee truck was visible. ^7y10o  
  
Law enforcement tracked down the [truck driver](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/03-Truck-Driver.md#) and asked him about seeing a bicyclist. [^2pkzb]    
The interview took place on [Friday-June-14th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/20-2013-06-14-Friday-June-14th-2013.md#), four months later, and was recorded. ^2vue5  
  
During the interview, [Mr Cain](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/03-Truck-Driver.md#.md#.md#.md#), the [truck driver](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/03-Truck-Driver.md#), said that he remembered seeing a man on a bike one night in February. [^qg81n]    
He did not remember the exact date, but said it was a Monday. ^za3c7  
  
He said he only glanced at the man on the bike twice. ^m-xv2  
  
During the [Friday-June-14th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/20-2013-06-14-Friday-June-14th-2013.md#) interview, [Mr Cain](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/03-Truck-Driver.md#.md#.md#) described the man as wearing dark clothing with a grizzled or unkempt look. ^9v173  
  
[Mr Cain](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/03-Truck-Driver.md#.md#.md#.md#) failed to mention any specific article of clothing or any specific features of the bicyclist such as race, age, height, weight, hair colour, heigh lengths or style, facial hair, or shape of face, eyes, nose, or chin. ^ltznh  
  
On [Wednesday-September-17th-2014](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/43-2014-09-17-September-17th-2014.md#), 19 months later, [Mr Cain](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/03-Truck-Driver.md#.md#.md#.md#) met with defence investigator Kathy McCall. In this second interview, [Mr Cain](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/03-Truck-Driver.md#.md#.md#.md#) stated he can identify the man he saw on the bike on that Monday morning as [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#). [Mr Cain](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/03-Truck-Driver.md#.md#.md#.md#) admitted that he followed the news stories in the case and had viewed pictures of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) in the news.  
  
The defence intends to call Dr. Jennifer Davenport to testify on witness identification. Dr. Davenport will testify about factors that exist in this case that negatively impact eyewitness reliability.

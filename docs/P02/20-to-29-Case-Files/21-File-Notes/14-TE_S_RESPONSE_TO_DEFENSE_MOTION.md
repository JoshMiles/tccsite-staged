- Alan told her, "I just want her to be done with"   
- Alan asked her if there was any way he could just get rid of her and nobody would know.  
- Another time as they were in bed, Amrine said Alan was really anxious, so to lighten up the situation she jokingly mentioned that he could use potassium chloride into the rectum to kill someone and it would be difficult to detect.

### Crime Scene  
  
- The initial warrant to search Susann's residence was obtained reference Snohomish County Southwest District Court No.SW2013·36.   
- The residence was processed by the Washington State Crime Scene Response Team (CSRT).   
- The CSRT members examined the noted axe and eliminated it as being involved in the crime because it did not test positive for blood, the material found near the axe was determined to be small pieces of wood and the axe had a large amount of dust on it indicating it had not been moved for some time. ^olt22  
  
- The WSP CSRT members continued their processing and a single droplet of blood was identified at the front entry way inside the residence. Sergeant Dan Christman stated the following regarding his professional opinion of this droplet of blood: ^blzmk  
  
>[!quote]   
> _Although it is possible this one bloodstain was created when_ wet _blood dropped off of blood-soaked items (clothing or weapons) being carried out of the scene by the suspect It is equally possible that the bloodstain was created when blood dripped from a fresh wound the suspect sustained during the incident. It should be noted that in the area where this single bloodstain was located, there are no other similar bloodstains present. Because_ _it_ is a symmetrical bloodstain (width is equal to its length) it was deposited from directly above the floor. and it makes sense that the blood could have dropped from the suspect as she were leaving the crime scene, and this one piece of evidence may contain the DNA profile of the suspect in this case. The importance of getting this blood evidence to the State Lab for further analysis is key to this investigation.  
  
- The WSP CSRT identified blood smearing on the inside and outside of the doorknob on the front door. ^nwbve  
- CSRT collected a sample of the blood for future analysis and examination. ^txrks  
  
- The CSRT members identified several foot impressions in the home including the hallway, kitchen, dining room and living room that tested positive for the presence of blood. ^q2jq9  
- The foot impressions were consistent in shape and size as being that of only one person. ^34-y0  
- The foot impressions were processed and photographed.   
- It was further determined the foot impressions were from a soft sole shoe or from some type of soft material such as a sock or shoe cover with a waffle type pattern. ^v4d0w  
  
- The WSP CSRT members processed the bathroom were the body was in the tub full of water. ^40yrp  
- The tub walls and bathroom floor did not have any water or residue staining to indicate the tub was full of water first before the body was placed in the tub. ^74b2p  
- CSRT identified and collected hairs from the victim's right hand and above her buttock. ^0wxa7  
- CSRT further identified and processed the blood transfer staining from some material left on the front edge of the tub. ^8mth5  
- These stains from the material had a small woven pattern of equally squared shapes consistent with an article of clothing or soft fabric. ^0p8xu  
  
- The WSP CSRT members processed the far south east bedroom where Officer Caban had looked into the window and saw the suspected bloodstains.   
- There was a large amount of blood and blood spatter in the room.   
- It was obvious based on the amount of blood and cast off (blood from an object in motion) of the blood; a body had been on the floor between the bed end interior wall.   
- The same body (victim) suffered severe trauma consistent with another human being (suspect) applying some form of lethal force resulting in a large pool of blood on the floor and heavy cast off blood on the walls and ceiling.  
  
- The scene in the bedroom was analyzed by Sergeant Christman and based on his professional opinion a violent assault occurred in the room.   
- The suspect(s) used an as yet unidentified object capable of causing enough blunt force and or sharp force trauma to seriously harm or cause **death** to the victim.   
- The suspect(s) continued striking the victim with the object multiple times, creating multiple events, meaning there were multiple layers of blood cast off and blood smearing on the interior wall and floor indicating there were breaks in the assault and then the assault continued on the same victim.   
- Based on the amount of blood cast off and the pattern of the casted off blood landed, it was determined the assaulted started while the victim was in bed.   
- The assault graduated to the right side of the bed onto the floor.   
- Based on the blood pattern and blood smearing on the floor it was evident the victim was moved in a dragging fashion out of the bedroom into the hallway and into the bathroom.   
- There was evidence the suspect(s) attempted to wipe up the blood in the room, hallway and bathroom based on the large swirl impressions on the floors in the bedroom, hallway and bathroom.  
  
- The WSP CSRT members noted there were several bloody finger type impressions throughout the scene but none of these impressions were AFIS quality nor did these prints show any ridge detail. ^dk3he  
- This in an indication the suspect(s) may have been wearing protective gloves during the commission of the crime. ^lm612  
  
- Based on the initial evidence and processing of the residence, it was determined a brutal and lethal assault started in the back bedroom. ^u9y07  
- The suspect{s) then dragged the victim into the bathroom and placed the victim in the bath tub face down. ^22lm8  
- The suspect(s) then filled the tub with water and positioned the victim's head under the water. ^7g3ds  
- The suspect(s) then moved (walked) about the hallway and kitchen during and after the crime based on the bloody foot impressions. ^8x2bc  
- The suspect then left the residence via the front door based on the bloody foot impression leading out of the living room to the front door. ^rhu-8  
  
- CSRT found no indication of presence of blood on the kitchen sink or on any of the sharp edge knives found In the kitchen. ^q1b9g  
- There was also no presence of blood detected in the bathroom sink. ^gm7sq  
  
- The Snohomish County Associate Medical Examiner Stanley Adams, MD and Snohomish County Medical Examiner Investigator Don Carman responded to the scene. ^-la0-  
- The body was removed from the tub and examined. ^lb789  
- The body was confirmed as an adult white female. ^peolk  
- The female's physical features fit the physical description of Susann Smith. ^31nnz  
- The female had suffered multiple blunt force trauma to the face and head.   
- The wounds were so severe Dr. Adams could not determine the initial number of injuries or how the injuries occurred other than they were not caused by self-infliction and not caused by accident.  
- Identification of the female was not initially confirmed due to the amount and severity of the wounds to her face. ^6mjsd  
- Dr. Adams and ME Investigator Carman took possession of the body.  
  
- Detectives conducted an experiment of filling the bath tub with water to the water mark left on the tub as found by the first responders. ^pyw73  
- It took 14 minutes and 45 seconds to fill the tub to the water line.  
- The experiment results would indicate the suspect(s) spent close to 15 minutes waiting for the tub to fill with enough water to submerge the victim. ^tencd

- Alan Smith filed a Petition for Dissolution on 11/18/2011.   
- While they had spent months attempting to reach a share agreement. ^t5mai  
- Alan and Susann could not reach an accord on all parenting issues. ^7u55r  
- Alan wanted a 50/50 share plan, but Susann felt a 50/50 plan would be too disruptive for the children. ^lbcaa  
  
- When it became dear an agreement on the issues between the parties could not be reached, Alan hired an attorney, Laurie Ummel, and filed a Motion for Temporary Order. ^nmwje  
- A hearing was held on 8/3/2012 and the Commissioner largely· adopted Susann's proposed parenting plan as the parties Temporary Parenting Plan. ^5rs4b  
- One of the issues raised by the Commissioner was that Alan had moved to the Ravenna neighborhood of Seattle and felt the commute to Bothell for the young children did not make a lot of sense. ^m1e49  
- Monthly support was set at $1,128 and maintenance was set at $600 and the Commissioner ordered Alan to pay Susann $2,000 in attorney fees.   
- After the hearing, all parties went into the hallways and were discussing the ruling.   
- Alan and Susan disagreed about an issue and Alan became upset.   
- Susann's attorney, John Ely advised Alan became upset and gave Susann an incredibly angry and chilling stare.   
- In his 15 years practicing of family law, Ely does not remember ever seeing a stare by one party to the other in the courthouse quite like the stare Alan gave Susann.   
- It was such an incredibly menacing stare - so much that he commented about it to both Susann and other office staff.  
- Susann denied Alan had ever physically abused her, but said that Alan could be emotionally threatening to her.   
- Susann indicated to Ely that Alan could be very aggressive to her by getting in her face and confronting her.

- Alan contended the GAL was necessary to investigate the parenting of the parties and the welfare of the children.  
- Ely felt this was odd, as Alan had not previously mentioned any concerns about Susann's parenting. ^46bmr  
  
- On 12/3/2012, a Commissioner heard the Motion to Appoint a GAL and she did not find any evidence to appoint a GAL. ^nnho8

- Alan provided a declaration at this time, claiming he went to a psychiatrist and reported his own observations/concerns. ^ac10t  
- Alan claimed that as a result of his discussions, the psychiatrist raised concerns that Susann may have sexually abused their 6 year old daughter. ^v0w66  
- Alan also said, "Susann is very much in need of psychiatric evaluation and the children need to be protected." ^ifjx8  
- Ely felt that Alan was engaging in 'double hearsay' with no real evidence and this showed Ely how 'outrageous" Alan had become in trying to convince the court. ^u-p5z

#### Interviews about Alan Smith  
  
- The witnesses interviewed described Alan Smith as "creepy", "weird" and awkward." ^5m-9j  
- They describe Alan as not being overly interested or involved with his children prior to separating from Susann. ^4uz--  
- One witness related that after the separation between Alan and Susann, Susann came home and discovered Alan inside her home with a new girlfriend, preparing a meal. ^oc9jh  
- Co-workers of Alan describe him discussing his hatred and hostility constantly, to the point where a supervisor at work told Alan that his continued discussion of his divorce proceedings was disrupting the work environment. ^8j07e  
- On the most recent business trip that Alan took to Ireland, from 02/06/2013 thru 02/09/2013, a co-worker described how Alan constantly and bitterly complained about Susann, and turned any conversation back to his issues with her.   
- Alan indicated a fear that Susann would attempt to take the two children back to her native Germany.

- On 2/14/2013, Detective Chissus and I contacted Alan at his apartment. He invited us in to speak to us.   
- Alan mentioned he was reluctant to cooperate with us because he believed we were, "Trying to traumatize me."   
- Alan's answers were very direct and non­ emotional regarding Susann and her personal life. ^mmpe6  
- Again Alan never asked about his children and only said I took his kids away from him. ^q4cpm  
- Alan declined to allow us to take photos of him and his injuries.   
- Alan did tell us he stayed 2-3 minutes longer than the other adults at the party at Susann's house on Saturday before leaving. ^iacfm

- During the interview, Alan mentioned that he and Susann communicated through email once a week and through phone calls three times a week on average.   
- The communication was centered on the children's schedules or to speak with the children.  
  
- Alan's description of Susann's taking him by the hand and taking him to the bedroom was inconsistent with the increasing acrimony of the divorce proceedings and custody issues. ^zah06  
- This acrimony was outlined in the court documents where Alan claimed Susann might be sexually abusing the children, and Alan calling Susann a "monster" after their last court hearing on 01/25/2013. ^ag0b7  
- Communication between the two was generally relegated to either emails or phone calls.  
  
- During the interview, Alan became agitated regarding personal questions we were asking about Susann.  
- He stood up from his chair and while answering the questions in a very direct tone, he continued to stare at me and walked into my personal space.   
- This was very unusual behavior and both Detective Chissus and I felt very uncomfortable.   
- Alan then asked us to leave his residence.  
  
### Blood Transfer Experiment  
  
- On 02/18/2013, Bothell Police Detectives along with Sergeant Christman conducted a blood transfer experiment. ^m2j13  
- Sergeant Chirstman led the experiment and used animal blood to simulate human blood. ^5ti0x  
- Samples of the same type of Kleenguard Chemical Splash Resistant Coverall suit that were found by detectives in Alan's vehicle during consent to search on 02/12/2013 were obtained from Home Depot and were used for the experiment. ^--4fq  
- A fiberglass bath tub similar to the tub at the scene was purchased and set up for the experiment. ^ciwoi  
- Animal Blood was applied to test samples of the Kleenguard suit and pressed against the sample bath tub to simulate blood transfer. ^19nvx  
- The experiment results were evaluated and determined to have similar characteristics to that of the blood transfer stains identified on the bath tub in the residence of 216 240th ST SW Bothell. ^ghy2w  
  
- Detectives located and confirmed Alan Smith did purchase two Kleenguard coveralls and masking tape at the Home Depot Store on 02/12/2013, at 13:40 hours, as he had stated to detectives.

- In the 2-3 years Pierce has known Alan, the majority of the conversations with Alan were related to the divorce of his wife.  
- Alan told Pierce that he felt repressed and mentally ·abused _by_ his ex-wife and would often say there was a conspiracy in the state of Washington to hide mental abuse.

### Alan Smith's Internet Searches  
  
- On 02/19/2013, Detective Chissus received information from Boeing Security via email, which in part included a McAfee Web Reporter report on Alan Smith's web browsing activity back to 11/20/2012.   
- In part, this report showed the following:  
  
- On 2/12/2013 at 0847 hour it appears that Alan Smith went to Google.com  
- 0848 hrs, from google.com he goes to Kayak.com (which is a travel website)  
- 0849 hrs, on Kayak.com it appears he searches for a flight from SEA to CCS with 1 adult and 2 children ages 6 and 3 (CCS is Simon Bolivar Airport in Venezuela).  
- 0913 hrs, it appears he exits off Kayak.com.  
- 0916 hrs, he goes onto Priceline.com (travel website)  
- 0927 hrs, he performs a Google search for, "Where is the Best Place to Live in South Central America"  
- 0931 hrs, Alan performs a Google search for, "Best Countries to Live and Work Abroad."  
- 0942 hrs, he appears to go back onto Kayak.com   
- 1256 hrs, he appears to go back onto Priceline.com  
- On 2/13/2013 at 0553 hours, it appears Alan goes onto Kayak.com  
- At 0606 hrs, it appears Alan searches for a flight from SEA to CCS with only 1 adult listed this time (**This is after receiving the death notification from police and having his children placed into CPS custody**).  
  
- The date parameters on his airline reservation searches were February 12th through March 5th, 2013.  
  
- Det. Chissus performed a Google search, typing, "Will Venezuela extradite to the U.S."   
- He noticed the 2nd and 4th site listed were titled, "If You Had to Disappear, Where Would You Go?"   
- The 3rd site listed is titled, "Venezuela Rejects U.S. Extradition Request: The 111 site listed is Wikipedia-The Free Encyclopaedia" providing the definition for extradition.  
  
- On 2/6/2013 Alan **appears** to visit virtuallythere.com, which is also a travel website.   
- He appears to have only been on this site from 1005-1006 hours.   
- Detective Chissus was unable to find any additional, specific information about Alan's visit to this site.  
  
- There is no other indication that Alan routinely searched any other travel websites until 2/6 and again on 2/12 and 2/13.   
- Based upon the information provided on Alan's searches regarding Venezuela with 1 adult and two children ages 6 and 3, it appears as if he was planning a trip to Venezuela for several weeks. ^l9d-3  
- The information about his Google search on "The Best Place to Live in South Central America"· and ·"Best Countries to Live and Work Abroad" suggest Alan had more permanent plans. ^n2-dv  
- Based upon the increasing acidic relations between Alan and Susann, it would also appear very unlikely that Susann would have agreed to allow the children to leave the country. ^9pq3g  
- It is also interesting to note that Alan made Kayak.com searches on the morning of 2/12, which was the day the children were scheduled to be returned to Susann. ^6nfd2  
  
- Based upon the above searches Alen performed on his Boeing laptop, it is reasonable to believe that Alan would make similar searches on his home personal computer(s).  
  
- Boeing Corporate Investigator Brien Ferguson advised Detective Chissus that Alan had a Boeing issued cell phone identified as a Blackberry through AT&T, phone number: 425-220 7064.   
- Based on my training and experience. it is common for people who are in possession of work phones to sometimes use these for personal use.   
- Corporate Investigator Ferguson advised Detective Chissus that Alan had recent email history on his blackberry relating to his contact with Susann.  
  
- Alan Smith's work laptop was identified as a Dell E6410, Boeing tag number A4914760, serial number 2WZSVM1.   
- Boeing Corporate Investigator Ferguson provided the following warning that the employee has to select "OK" to continue past this banner on their computer.

- Detective Pavlovich reported Susann's phone contains text message history dating back to 12/13/11.   
- During the last 14 month period form 12/13/11 thru 02/12/13, Alan and Susann exchanged a total of 127 messages, for an average of 9 per month. ^mrx8c  
- It was Detective Pavlovich's experience the 127 messages in that time frame was "a very low volume." ^dv5jx  
  
- Detective Pavlovich further reported, all of the messages or exchanges (excluding the message on 02/12/13) between Alan and Susann in that time frame are conversations in which they discuss transferring children back and forth or other issues related to the children or between them. ^jzp3z  
- In no other messages does Alan ever simply write "Hi". ^7wznb  
- All other messages have specific content or revolve around specific issues to be discussed or handled between them.  
  
- Susann Smith had Alan's contact information listed in her phone as follows:  
  
> Smith, Alan  
> 206/369-7614  
> 425/717-4710  
> 425/387-0558  
> [alan-ucsu@yahoo.com](mailto:alan-ucsu@yahoo.com)  
>  [aIan.smith7@boeing.com](mailto:aIan.smith7@boeing.com)  
  
- Your affiant knows from training and experience that people own cellular telephones and other portable electronic devices for the purpose of being able to use them wherever they are, and as such carry them virtually constantly, or are nearly always within the near vicinity of their cell phones and/or portable devices.  
- I know that criminals often use cellular phones to communicate with accomplices and will sometimes store accomplice's contact information in contact lists, speed dial lists, or other areas of the phone.   
- Communication between suspects and other involved parties can occur in many ways, including through typical cellular phone voice calls, instant messaging, text messages, SMS communications, chat sessions, and email.  
- This information can be used to assist and corroborate surveillance officers' observations and anticipate future movements and locations of the suspect and/or his or her criminal associates, by establishing his or her communication and location habit patterns over time.   
- For example, if the telephone consistently signals the same tower both late at night and in the early morning hours, it is reasonable to conclude that the suspect is living, sleeping, hiding or working at a night job in that vicinity .  
  
- Your affiant knows, based on my training and experience, that those involved in criminal enterprises sometimes will use multiple phones in the commission of crimes or to facilitate criminal activity and to avoid detection by law enforcement.   
- They also sometimes possess multiple phones to have a secondary means of communication if a phone is lost or seized by law enforcement.   
- I know through my training and experience that criminals also use cellular phones to document criminal activities through photographs, videos, and digital or voice memos.   
- Many mobile data devices have camera and video capabilities as well.   
- I know that images saved in a cellular phone or mobile data device can contain location evidence and photographs of criminal activity, contraband items, items of evidence, crime victims and criminal accomplices.  
  
- Sometimes users sync their cellular telephones to cloud services, which backup or simply store data from the phone or its other internal or external storage.   
- In this case, data stored on the cellular telephone can identify the provider and locations where information, records and evidence regarding use and/or possession of the phone has been stored by suspects.   
- Users of cellular telephones can also send images or documents or other data to others via email, text messages, IM messages and SMS communications.   
- Cellular telephone providers routinely store such messages in company servers, at least until the message has been retrieved by its intended recipient.  
  
- Sometimes it might be possible to find data or records that can be used to corroborate details of an alibi.  
- Other categories of exculpatory evidence might also be available that can help investigators to rule out an individual as a suspect.

- The investigation in this case has led investigators to believe that Susann Smith was murdered sometime after she was last seen on 2240 hours Sunday, February 10, 2013 and the morning Monday, February 11th when she failed to show up to work.   
- Alan Smith had shown up to work on both Monday and Tuesday February 11th and 12th.  
  
- Bothell Police Officers have been observing Alan's activities and the only vehicle he has been seen driving is his 2000 Mercedes SW.   
- On 2/16/2013, Forensic Scientists from WSP Crime Lab processed Alan's SUV and traces of blood were found on the steering wheel, center console and floor mat from Alan's SUV. ^dld3r  
- Traces of blood were also found on Alan's backpack. ^c-ocw  
-  When your affiant and Det. Stone initially spoke with Alan at his work on 2/12/2013, Alan went to his office and retrieved this same back pack before leaving work in the SUV. ^fouga  
- On 2/19/2013, your affiant Detective Glen Chissus, received web browsing information from Boeing Security regarding Alan Smith's company issued Dell Latitude laptop (item #1).   
- In part, the report showed Alan's issued laptop showed searches on a travel website for 1 adult and 2 children, ages 6 and 3 to Venezuela.   
- These searches were performed on the morning of 2/12/2013 before your affiant and Det Stone contacted Alan to notify him of his estranged wife's probable death.  
- On 2/13/2013, the next day after we made notification with Alan and after he had been advised that Child Protective Services had custody of his children, his laptop showed a search on the same travel website for 1 adult only to Venezuela.  
- Other web searches located on Alan's laptop through Google, asked, "The Best Place to Live in South Central America" and "Best Countries to Live and Work Abroad."  
- Based upon the increasing acidic relations between Alan and Susann Smith, it would appear very unlikely that Susann would have agreed to allow the children to leave the country with Alan.  
- Boeing security also provided information that Alan sent and received personal emails from his laptop (or Blackberry) to Susann Smith related to child custody issues and schedules.  
- Also based upon the above searches performed on Alan's company issued laptop, it is reasonable to believe that Alan would make similar searches on his personal computers (items #3 and 4).  
  
- Alan's company issued Blackberry cellular phone (Above item #2) accesses the same Oulook email system as his laptop computer and he is able to send and receive personal emails on his cell phone.

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Detectives have subsequently gathered the receipt from Home Depot on this purchase by Alan Smith. </span>  
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A review of the receipt shows that one set of coveralls was listed as SKU #4233 and one SKU#4363. </span>  
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> This would indicate that two different types of coveralls were purchased. </span>  
- Through previously obtained search warrants, detectives searched Alan Smith's residence, his place of work and his two known vehicles.  
- Detectives also searched Susann's Smith's residence and two known vehicles.   
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A sheet of MDF plywood, which appeared to be the same plywood on the October 27, 2012 receipt, was located at Alan's residence. </span>  
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">None of the other items listed on this purchase were located in or at any of the above locations by detectives. </span>  
- Your affiant compared and photographed the listed items by SKU from the receipt at Home Depot.  
  
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">On February 12, 2013 Alan Smith used cash to purchase two more sets of disposable coveralls (both SKU # 4363) and a roll of masking tape at Home Depot.</span>   
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">On that same evening, your affiant located two sets of coveralls (SKU # 4363) during a consent to search on Alan's vehicle.</span>  
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The coveralls were located along with a new roll of masking tape inside a Home Depot bag. </span>  
- Later on 2/12/2013, your affiant and other detectives received consent to search Alan's residence.   
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">No items listed on either receipt from Home Depot were located inside his residence on that night.</span>  
  
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">On 2/22/2013 detectives searched Alan Smith's residence under the authority of a search warrant and two sets of coveralls (SKU #4363) along with a new roll of masking tape were located in the Home Depot shopping bag at Alan Smith's residence.</span>  
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">These are believed to be the same two coveralls (and masking tape) located inside his vehicle on 2/12/2013.</span>

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Your affiant later provided a similar mallet **(same** SKU) purchased by Alan Smith on 10/27/2013 to the Medical Examiner. The ME advised it is conceivable the blunt force injuries on Susan Smith could have been caused by this type of rubber mallet.</span>  
  
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Investigators determined the evidence at the scene of the murder (Susann Smith's residence) suggests the suspect(s) most likely cieaned up the crime scene and evidence is consistent that the suspect(s) used gloves, i.e. fingerprints in blood displaying no ridge detail one might expect from an unclothed hand. </span>  
- As mentioned previously in the attached supporting affidavit detectives and the Crimes Scene Response Team located what appeared to be fabric pattern marks in blood on the bath tub that held Susann Smith's body.

### Addendum to search warrant issued on 02/27/2013

- That search warrant and search warrant affidavit are both attached to his addendum and incorporated by reference.   
- This ongoing series of search warrants and search warrant affidavits are in regard to the ongoing homicide investigation of 37 year old Susann Smith who's body was discovered on 02/12/2013 in her residence of 216 240th ST SW Bothell, in Snohomish County Washington.  
  
- The warrant and affidavit outline why Alan J. Smith (07-19-1975) is a person of interest regarding the murder of his estrange wife, Susann Smith.

Therefore AT&T could not make a search of the requested records and data.  
  
- This addendum has added the phone number (206)369-7614 to the identified Samsung cellular phone SIN: R21C4082X0F determined to be owned by Alan Smith.

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">When his aunt asks what the threat is, Alan responded:</span>

[John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#) was [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#)'s lawyer during her dissolution proceedings with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#). After [Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#) Brudvik had made her initial rulings on Temporary Orders related to the divorce on [Friday-August-3rd-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/05-2012-08-03-Friday-August-3rd-2012.md#), the parties and their respective lawyers went out into the hall to reduce [the Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#)'s rulings to writing. ^jhnjt  
  
While this was going on, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#) and [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#) disagreed on an issue relating to time with the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#) during the summer. According to attorney [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) got upset; and then fixed upon [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#) what he described as an "incredibly angry" stare. [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#) describes the stare as lasting approximately 5 seconds. [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#) indicated in his written statement to police that the stare was something the like he had never seen in some 15 years of practise. The glare was concerning enough to [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#) that he asked [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) about it, and mentioned it to his staff. ^zeg12  
  
The State would ask the Court to deny [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#)'s motion to exclude this testimony from attorney [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#).

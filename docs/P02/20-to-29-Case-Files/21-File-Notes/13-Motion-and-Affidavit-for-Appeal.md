[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) moves the Court for an order allowing [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) to seek review at public expense and providing appointment of attorneyt on appeal.  
  
Dated [Monday-March-9th-2015](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/56-2015-03-09-Monday-March-9th-2015.md#).  
  
The declaration was as follows:  
  
I was tried and convicted on one count of First Degree Murder with a Deadly Weapon in front of the Honorable Lind C Krese.  
  
A Judgement and sentence was entered in this matter on the [Thursday-March-5th-2015](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/55-2015-03-05-Thursday-March-5th-2015.md#).  
  
I desire to appeal the conviction and the judgement imposed.    
I believe that the appeal has merit and is not frivolous and make the following assignments of error:  
  
- The Court erred in denying the motion to suppress testimony under the priest-penitent privilege;  
- The Court erred in denying the motion for a Frye hearing;  
- The Court erred in not suppressing additional materials in the 3.6 hearing;  
- The Court erred in not suppressing additional statements in the 3.5 hearing under both CrR 3.5 and the constitutional arguments raised;  
- The Court erred in denying the motion to change venue;  
- The Court erred in denying the motion for new counsel;  
- The Court erred in granting continuances of [Defendant](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s objection;  
- The Court erred in denying the defence motion to dismiss pursuant to State vs Green, 94 Wn.2d 216 (1980).  
- The Court erred in finding there was sufficient evidence to convict;  
- My attorneys provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to present evidence, failing to cross examine state's witnesses properly, failing to call necessary defence witnesses to establish crucial facts, failing to submit all request materials for sentencing, and by failing to communicate with me adequately throughout the course of the case.

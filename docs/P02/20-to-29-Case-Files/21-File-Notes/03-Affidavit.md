On [Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#), during the early morning hours, [the defendant](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) (dob 1975/07/19) savagely beat, cut and ultimately drowned his estranged wife, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#) at her [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#) home, located at [216 240th St SW, Bothell, WA](geo:47.78026465,-122.23629542497216).[^1] ^9pr8u  
  
The attack was precipitated by a contentious dissolution and custody battle between [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#). The attack has essentially orphaned [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s two young [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#), aged six and three. The attack appears to have been carefully planned out, with extensive efforts made at both obscuring who the killer was, and at leaving little [forensic](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/04-Forensic-Evidence.md#) evidence for investigators to find.  
  
The murder of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) initially came to the attention of law enforcement on the morning of [Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) when a co-worker of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) called the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#) Police Department and indicated that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had not come to work either [Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#.md#) or [Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#). According to the co-worker, efforts had been made at calling [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), with no success. The failure to either show up for work or two answer phone calls was described as highly unusual for [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#). ^y-pur  
  
[Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#) officers arrived at [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home for a welfare check at approximately 11:30am. Officers knocked and got no response. The police then walked around the home and peered in windows. While looking in the window of a room subsequently identified as [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s bedroom, police saw significant amounts of blood on the floor and wall. This room had obviously been the scene of a violent struggle. ^3aiak  
  
Police entered the home thru the unlocked front door. Inside the home, police discovered [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been murdered in a particularly brutal fashion. Based on the blood splatter evidence, it was apparent that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had initially been attacked while she was in her bed. The attack then moved to the floor between the bed and the wall. This area had extensive blood pooling, smearing and spattering. The blood splatter was consistent with a medium velocity bloodletting event i.e a beating with either fists or some type of blunt object. ^gx1b8  
  
[Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was apparently rendered defenceless at this location, as bloody drag marks led from this location down the hall into a bathroom. During this portion of the struggle, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s panties and Kotex (menstrual pad) were either removed by her assailant or came off during the fight. ^ve1sz  
  
[Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was menstruating at the time of her murder, so it is unlikely she would have been sleeping without her panties and feminine hygiene product. ^yd897  
  
Inside the bathroom, police discovered [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#)'s body inside the bathtub. The bathtub was full of water. [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#)'s body was clothed only in a grey t-shirt, and was face down in the water. The bathwater was tepid, and [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body temperature was consistent with her having been in the tub for several days. ^bqqpt  
  
Police later determined it would take approximately 17 minutes to fill the tub to the point they found it in. Due to the injuries that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#) had sustained to her face, police were initially unable to positively identify her. ^r7a1m  
  
The police requested the assistance of the Washing State Patrol Crime Scene Response Team (CSRT) in processing the death scene. During the processing of the home police discovered a number of footprints left in blood in various locations in the house. Some of these bloody footprints appeared to have been of a bare foot showing through a blood soaked sock, some of them appeared to be that of a shoed foot, a shoe that had a distinct pattern on the sole, and some of them appeared to be that of a foot wearing some sort of covering, as of yet unidentified, that left a distinct patterned impression in the blood. ^b1o5c  
  
On the bathtub, police discovered several bloody transfer impressions with a very distinct pattern. It appeared these bloody transfer impressions in blood without any ridge detail, leading police to conclude that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s killer had been wearing gloves. No murder weapons were located at the death scene. It appeared that at least some preliminary efforts at cleaning had been attempted. ^jl4d-  
  
Police located no signs of forced entry. There was no evidence that the home had been ransacked or searched. Various items (laptops, smart phones, TV's) that would commonly be stolen in a burglary were left untouched. It appeared that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been targeted. ^nekyb  
  
The Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office conducted an [autopsy](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/02-Autopsy.md#) on [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body on [Wednesday-February-13th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/04-2013-02-13-Wednesday-February-13th-2013.md#). At [autopsy](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/02-Autopsy.md#), the pathologist discovered [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had suffered multiple injuries to her head and face: 12 sharp force injuries and 10 blunt force injuries. The blunt force blows caused a skull fracture that would have caused [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s death. However, it was apparent that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#) was still alive when placed in the bathtub, as the medical examiner discovered that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had drowned while face down in the tub. Other than a number of defensive bruises on her forearms and hands, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had no injuries other than the 22 blows and cuts to her head. **No evidence of sexual assault was found.** ^roict  
  
Police soon learned that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s estranged husband, and that he worked at the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) plant in Everett. Two detectives drove to the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#) plant to interview [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#), arriving there at approximately 3pm on [Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#.md#). Police initially identified themselves, and indicated that they were investigating a "serious crime", and that police had found a dead body in his wife's home. ^yfaul  
  
Police also advised [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) that his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#) were safe. **[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) did not ask questions as to whose body had been found, nor did he offer any assistance to police.** ^2v-kp  
  
According to the two detectives, **[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s reaction seemed rehearsed.** ^5bgkf  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) gave police a description of his activities the last few days.  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) indicated that he had returned from a business trip to Ireland on [Saturday-February-9th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/19-2013-02-09-Saturday-February-9th-2013.md#) and picked up his two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#) from [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) at approximately 2:30pm.  
  
According to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), this was the last time he had seen [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). ^2de3j  
  
According to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), he and the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#) had watched movies at his [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#) Sunday evening ([Sunday-February-10th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/20-2013-02-10-Sunday-February-10th-2013.md#)), and that they had all slept there. ^xlz25  
  
The following morning, [Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) stated he had dropped the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#) off at day-care, picking them up after work. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) spent Monday night, [Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#.md#.md#), at his [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#) and on Tuesday morning ([Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#.md#.md#)), he once again dropped them off at day-care. ^t8mx7  
  
During the course of the interview, police noticed that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had an injury to his left hand - it appeared swollen. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) indicated this injury occurred when his 3 year old boy accidentally hit him with a hatchet.  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) ultimately ended the interview after being asked why he might harm [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), stating "*I think I had better talk to an attorney.*".  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was advised that [Child Protective Services](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#) ([CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#)) would be taking custody of his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) until the investigation was concluded.  
  
Police left the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) plant at approximately 4:30pm.  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) reinitiated contact with police at approximately 6:30pm, and indicated that he would voluntarily allow police to search both his [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#) and his [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#).   
  
Police began a search of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#.md#) at approximately 7pm. During the search, police observed that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had a [Garmin](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#) portable [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#) in the front dash. Police also located a plastic bag from Home Depot. Inside the bag were two unopened bags containing [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#). ^78mqr  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) indicated the [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#) were purchased earlier that day as he planned to pain an accent wall at his [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#).  
  
Police also found an unopened box of Playtex brand latex gloves and a new 5 gallon gas container. ^382hs  
  
Police started the search of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) shortly after completing the search of the [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#.md#.md#). During the course of this search, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) consented to a taped interview in which he laid out in detail his activities of the last several days. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) indicated he had purchased the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#) [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#) at the Home Depot located at 128th and Highway 99 in south Everett. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) indicated he had lunch at Taco Bell. ^5e3bz  
  
Police later confirmed that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) purchased the [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#.md#) at Home Depot at 1:40pm on [Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#.md#.md#.md#). ^mbz17  
  
Police contacted [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#)'s family law attorney, and pulled the various legal filings in the divorce and custody proceedings. It became readily apparent that the court proceedings had turned acrimonious.

The initial petition of Dissolution was filed [Friday-November-18th-2011](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/04-2011-11-18-Friday-November-18th-2011.md#). On [Friday-August-3rd-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/05-2012-08-03-Friday-August-3rd-2012.md#), [the Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#) largely adopted a proposed Temporary Parenting Plan submitted by [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). According to [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#)'s attorney, [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#), after the hearing, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had a disagreement about an issue and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) became angry and gave [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) a menacing stare. ^5p1e-  
  
According to [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#), this "incredibly menacing stare" was something the like he had never seen in 15 years of practise. Attorney [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#) was so concerned about this interaction between the two that he commented on it to both [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and staff at his office.  
  
On [Thursday-December-13th-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/11-2012-12-13-Thursday-December-13th-2012.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) filed paperwork claiming that he now believed [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) may be sexually assaulting the two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). These filings were part of a motion to reconsider a failure by [the Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#.md#) to order a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) appointed to the case. ^h0zed  
  
On [Thursday-January-10th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/14-2013-01-10-Thursday-January-10th-2013.md#), [the Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#.md#.md#) denied the motion. ^og0hu  
  
On [Friday-January-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/15-2013-01-11-Friday-January-11th-2013.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) filed a Motion of Revision of [the Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s Ruling on the GAL. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) also filed papers indicating that he was fearful of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) moving the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to her native Germany. This hearing was held on [Friday-January-25th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/16-2013-01-25-Friday-January-25th-2013.md#), in front of [Judge Fair](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/04-Judge-Fair.md#) who found no merit to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s accusations, and again found for [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). According to [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#), after this hearing, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been waiting alone in the hall when she was approached by [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and called a "monster". ^3i2pk  
  
Police also contacted an ex-girlfriend of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Rachel-Amrine.md#). [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Rachel-Amrine.md#) had been dating [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) from September 2012 ([September-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/06-2012-09-September-2012.md#)) until late November 2012 ([November-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/10-2012-11-November-2012.md#). According to [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Rachel-Amrine.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) often "ranted and ranted" about [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), the amount of child support he was paying, and his fear that she would attempt to move the two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to Germany. During one angry rant in October 2012 ([October-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/08-2012-10-October-2012.md#)), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) queried something to the effect: "how could he make someone disappear without anyone knowing". Several days following this in another angry phone call [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) stated that he "just wanted her to be done with". [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Rachel-Amrine.md#) also related that in one conversation she had with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), she mentioned that a friend of hers from the military told her how one could beat someone with a phone book and not leave any bruising. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) replied that "you could do that with a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#) too". [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Rachel-Amrine.md#) helped [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) move from an [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#) in Seattle to an [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#.md#) in [November-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/10-2012-11-November-2012.md#). During this move, [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Rachel-Amrine.md#) saw and packed a rubber headed [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#). ^9h1wa  
  
Police interviewed a number of co-workers of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) from [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#). One of these co-workers had known [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) since [January-2011](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/03-2011-01-January-2011.md#), and worked fairly closely with him. This co-worker termed the last year [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s "descent into madness" as he obsessed about his divorce, his hatred for [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), and his fear of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) getting custody of the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and moving to Germany with them. ^6un01  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) adamantly told this co-worker that he would not allow [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to get custody, nor allow her to move to Germany with them. This co-worker began avoiding contact with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) as he did not want to hear him obsess about the divorce.  
  
Two other co-workers, [Matthew Pierce](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Matthew-Pierce.md#) and [Colin Warner](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Colin-Warner.md#), travelled to Ireland with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), leaving [Monday-February-4th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/17-2013-02-04-Monday-February-4th-2013.md#) and returning [Saturday-February-9th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/19-2013-02-09-Saturday-February-9th-2013.md#.md#). According to [Matthew Pierce](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Matthew-Pierce.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) talked almost exclusively about his divorce during the trip. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) realised that the court hearings were not going in his favour and he was angry, blaming the court system as being rigged to favour women and to take all of his money from him. ^1xs5t  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was angry about [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) potentially gaining custody and moving to Germany. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) described [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) as a "psychopath", "evil", and "pure evil".  
  
A search warrant was served on [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s personal iPad, and Android cell phone.  
  
In [December-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/12-2012-12-December-2012.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) made internet searches on Google for "How realistic is CSI Miami", "Most realistic crime shows", "Forensic Files", "Where do people get fake passports", "How long does it take for [DNA](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/05-DNA.md#) test", "How much material is needed for [DNA](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/05-DNA.md#)", and Forensic [DNA](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/05-DNA.md#) FAQ's from Orchid Cellmark Laboratory. ^52zkv  
  
A subsequent search of financial records indicated that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#) ordered an entire season of Forensic Files in December from Netflix. [^zqo0f]    
During [forensic](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/04-Forensic-Evidence.md#.md#) searches of both [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s cell phone and [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s cell phone, it was discovered that after being advised of the body found in [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) texted [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s phone "Hi Susie" at 10:23pm on [Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). [^3lb-p]    
A search of all electronic communication between [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) indicated this was a highly unusual text. [^pf60z]    
There was text history going back 14 months to 12/13/11, consisting of 127 text messages between [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).    
In none of these texts did [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) ever simply write "hi" - all of the texts revolved around discussions of their [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) or issues relating to them, or issues between [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).    
In none of the texts, other than one sent [Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), did [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) address [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) as "Susie".  
  
Several search warrants were served on [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s financial records.   
  
On [Sunday-October-27th-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/07-2012-10-27-Sunday-October-27th-2012.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) purchased a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#.md#), two sets of [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), and disposable shoe covers at Home Depot. ^adwpf  
  
In the various searches of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#.md#.md#.md#), police were never able to locate these items.  
  
Analysis done on the bloodstain impressions present on the bathtub where [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body was located, found that the fabric on the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#.md#) [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#) was visually similar to the bloodstain impressions, and that experimental bloodstains done in the lab with the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#) [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were consistent with what was found at the death scene. ^1kt2m  
  
According to the bloodstain pattern analyst "the [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#) Coverall fabric produced a patterned contact bloodstain with a limited association of some characteristics of the contact bloodstains observed at the original crime scene. This is class evidence which means that the object has characteristics common to a group of similar objects, but not one single object. And although similarities are notes; there are significant limiting factors between the questioned and known impressions.". ^rj7e9  
  
Similarly, police purchased a [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#) identical to the [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#) purchased by [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) on [Sunday-October-27th-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/07-2012-10-27-Sunday-October-27th-2012.md#.md#) and requested a [forensic](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/04-Forensic-Evidence.md#.md#.md#) scientist compare the [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#.md#) to the circular blunt force injuries suffered by [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). The forensic scientist concluded that several of the multiple blunt force injuries suffered by [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) exhibited the same class characteristics and arched dimensions as the [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#.md#.md#). ^7rrk7  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s financial records show that on [Saturday-November-24th-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/09-2012-11-24-Saturday-November-24th-2012.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) purchased a [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#) for $617 from Gregg's Greenlake in Seattle. ^lor3j  
  
This is contrary to what he told police during his first recorded interview with them on [Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), where he told them his last bike ([bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#.md#)) was stolen from his Ravenna [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) sometime in [October-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/08-2012-10-October-2012.md#.md#). ^p1hcc  
  
A check of surveillance video ([CCTV](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/02-CCTV.md#.md#)) on the route from [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#) to [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home (1.7 miles each way) located a biker coming from the direction of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#) at 2:24am in the early morning hours of [Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#.md#.md#.md#). The quality of the video is such that one can say little more than it is an individual on a [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#.md#.md#.md#). A check of [traffic cameras](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/02-CCTV.md#) located a biker eastbound of 240th St. make a left hand turn (northbound) onto the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)-Everett Highway at 4:13am. This would be the most direct route from [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). Once again, the quality is such that little can be said other than that it shows a person on a [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#.md#.md#). ^nqxr-  
  
The [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#) that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) purchased in [November-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/10-2012-11-November-2012.md#.md#), and neglected to tell police about, was seen unattended and unsecured at the [Canyon Park QFC](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Canyon-Park-QFC.md#) by an employee there. This is a store that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) frequents. In fact, his financial records indicate that he was there on both [Sunday-February-10th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/20-2013-02-10-Sunday-February-10th-2013.md#.md#) and [Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). ^3qyh6  
  
This witness estimates the date he first saw the [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#.md#) as around [Thursday-February-21st-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/06-2013-02-21-Thursday-February-21st-2013.md#). This same witness later saw the same [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) unattended and unlocked at Holiday Inn Express in the days following [Thursday-February-21st-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/06-2013-02-21-Thursday-February-21st-2013.md#), but before [Thursday-February-28th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/09-2013-02-28-Thursday-February-28th-2013.md#). ^szlna  
  
The witness called police who came and collected the [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#). A check of the [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#.md#.md#)'s serial number confirmed it was the same [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) as the one purchased by [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in [November-2012](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/10-2012-11-November-2012.md#.md#.md#). ^b027t  
  
The time frame that the various cameras ([CCTV](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/02-CCTV.md#)) show a bicyclist on the route to and from [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) is consistent with the time frame police believe the murder occurred. Police believe [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) may have left his [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) unattended and unsecured in the hopes that it would be stolen, this disposing of it as possible evidence. ^ccr9m  
  
Police also served a warrant on the [Garmin GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#) in [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). An analysis of the data from the [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#) device showed that on [Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) travelled to the area of the 23200 block of 2nd Ave. SE (location of Little Bears Day-care, where his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) went) at 7:54am, and then travelled to the location of the Albertson's parking lot located at 12811 Beverly Park Rd., in Lynnwood, arriving at 8:10am, and not leaving until 8:20am. ^21cxg  
  
The [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#.md#) located the [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in the northwest side of the parking lot. Two large dumpsters are located at this location. Police theorize that this is where [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) may have disposed of various bloody items related to the murder of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). ^jzvs9  
  
The [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) then indicated [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) drove to work. According to the data from the [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#.md#.md#), the stop at the Albertson's parking lot is not a normal stop for [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), and it is a stop he neglected to tell police about. ^kttvy  
  
The following day, [Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#), the [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) data indicated that, as [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) told police, he left [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#.md#) plant at approximately 1:15pm. The data indicates that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) then drove to the 11300 block of Evergreen Way, Everett, arriving at 1:21pm, and leaving at 1:35pm. This is the location of the Everett Walmart. ^8obpg  
  
Police were able to confirm that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) did in fact stop at Walmart via surveillance video ([CCTV](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/02-CCTV.md#.md#.md#)) and receipts. ^buz6d  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) purchased a pair of [croc-style shoes](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/07-Croc-style-Shoes.md#), two pairs of Playtex gloves, and a gas can with cash. ^qrmn9    
This cash transaction is unusual as [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) usually uses a debit or credit card. ^kr3ud    
The soles of the croc shoes visually matched some of the shoe prints left in blood at the death scene. ^deb7g  
  
Police purchased an identical pair of shoes and asked the crime lab to compare the soles of the shoes to the impressions left in blood at the scene. ^x1gwk  
  
The conclusion from the forensic scientist was that "the shoes can be included in the possible designs that correspond to this impression". ^btri5

These [croc style shoes](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/07-Croc-style-Shoes.md#.md#) have not been recovery by police during any of their searches of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home or [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). ^rcj3e  
  
Following the purchase of the shoes, gloves, and gas can, the [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) data indicated that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) drove to the 11915 Highway 99, the location of the Home Depot. ^v5fr9

As described above, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) admitted purchasing two [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) at Home Depot at this time. ^n0g3z  
  
After [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s departure from Home Depot, the [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) data indicates that he drove to [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), arriving at the intersection of 240th St SE and Meridian Ave South at 2:00pm. ^e046k  
  
This intersection is several blocks from [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home. ^id37i  
  
At the time [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) arrived at this intersection, police were manning a barricade, and not allowing any travel any further west on 240th. It is unknown what [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s purpose was in going to the area of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home on [Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), but it is known that at that time he had in his [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) two packages of [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) [coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), a gas can, two pairs of latex gloves, and a pair of [croc style shoes](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/07-Croc-style-Shoes.md#.md#.md#). ^0i0z8  
  
After reaching the barricade, the [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) data indicates that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) drove back to work at [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), arriving there at 2:47pm - 15 minutes before detectives arrived. ^9ks-l

The morning following the purchases at Walmart and Home Depot, [Wednesday-February-13th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/04-2013-02-13-Wednesday-February-13th-2013.md#.md#), the [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) data indicates that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) left his home at 4:25am and headed south on I-405, exiting 405 in Bellevue at the NE 8th St exit, making a U-turn and getting back on I-405. ^-3tvw  
  
The [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) data shows that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) then continued back north on 405, ultimately ending his journey at the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) plant at 5:29am. His arrival at [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#) was confirmed by [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) security pass records. ^o0t7m  
  
Shortly after his arrival at [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#), at 5:53am, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) began the internet searches for flights to South America as described above. ^xjbwn  
  
During the day, [Wednesday-February-13th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/04-2013-02-13-Wednesday-February-13th-2013.md#.md#.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) makes four separate cash withdrawals from an ATM at [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#). [^pbpkf]    
The amount of these withdrawals is $1500. [^v8bwz]    
It is unknown why [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) drove to Renton in the early morning hours of [Wednesday-February-13th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/04-2013-02-13-Wednesday-February-13th-2013.md#.md#.md#.md#) [^unn10]    
However, it is clear that this drive is unprecedented based on the data stored in the [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#.md#.md#). ^w-cpy  
  
Search warrants were also served on [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s person, specifically his feet, in a hope of determining whether or not they left the bloody footprints at the death scene.  
  
The warrant allowed the taking of detailed photos of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s feet, the taking of inked impressions of his feet both standing and walking, and a video of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) walking.  
  
These items were sent to Sgt. S.L Massey of the Royal Canadian Mountain Police (RCMP), Forensic Identification Services, along with photos of the various bloody footprints from.   
  
On [Tuesday-June-25th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/25-2013-06-25-Tuesday-June-25th-2013.md#), Sgt Massey completed her examination. [^t4971]    
Three of the bloody footprints were found to "support the proposition that this impression could have been made by the right foot of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)", "Support" is a term of art that means based on the class characteristic details such as overall size, location of toe pads, overall widths of the heel and arch, the examiner would include this person as being the possible originator of the impression in question. Sgt Massey opined that there is a very low occurrence of a conclusion that someone "did make" a questioned foot impression, particularly when the foot in question was in some type of sock. ^0ilc9  
  
The same day that Sgt Massey finished the foot morphology examination ([Tuesday-June-25th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/25-2013-06-25-Tuesday-June-25th-2013.md#.md#)), [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#) contacted the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) Police.  
  
[Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) said that he had met [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) at a potluck organised by some members of the church they both attend, City Church. [^nl96a]    
[Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#.md#.md#) is an ordained minister, but does not hold a position of minister or pastor at City Church, nor is he employed or assigned as staff at City Church. [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#.md#)' role at City Church is that of a volunteer bible study group leader. ^82rjo  
  
When [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) initially met [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), he was aware [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was a "person of interest" in his wife's murder.    
Due to the ongoing publicity surrounding the investigation into [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#)'s murder, the staff at City Church told [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and his new girlfriend, [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#), they were no longer welcome to attend services at either the Seattle or Kirkland church campus. ^3unzj  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was told this either [Saturday-June-22nd-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/23-2013-06-22-Saturday-June-22nd-2013.md#) or [Sunday-June-23rd-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/24-2013-06-23-Sunday-June-23rd-2013.md#). ^91dat    
Being turned away from the City Church upset [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#). ^w4n2t  
  
They called [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) on [Sunday-June-23rd-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/24-2013-06-23-Sunday-June-23rd-2013.md#.md#), asking to meet at Starbucks on south Lake Union. [^r0uzc]    
[Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) agreed. ^6edhg  
  
While [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#) and [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)' wife spoke inside Starbucks, [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) spoke inside [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s vehicle. ^q5mvx

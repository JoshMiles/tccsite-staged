Sentencing scheduled for [Monday-February-23rd-2015](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/53-2015-02-23-Monday-February-23rd-2015.md#), at 1:30pm. ^y3csb  
  
This Court convicted [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) of Murder in the First Degree on [Wednesday-February-4th-2015](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/50-2015-02-04-Wednesday-February-4th-2015.md#). The Court heard the better part of three weeks testimony prior to reaching this verdict. ^swi5b  
  
Murder in the First Degree is a level XV offense. ^16xqb  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) has no prior criminal history, thus having an offender score of "0". [^-ta2j]    
  
The standard range sentence for [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) is 240 to 320 months. [^bp8x6]    
  
However, the Court also found that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of offense. [^2o526]    
  
This finding adds 24 months to both the top and the bottom of the standard range, for an actual standard range of 264 to 344 months. ^un1zu  
  
The Court also found that this was a crime of Domestic Violence. [^gl3rs]    
  
This offense also carries 36 months of community custody. ^1lnd1  
  
The State's recommendation is that the Court sentence [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) to the high end of the actual range, 344 months. ^-z-s9  
  
In looking at the facts of this case it is hard to imagine a more calculated, arrogant and selfish act of violence. [^grne2]    
  
This murder was no "heat of the moment" event. [^7ckb9]    
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) chose a time when [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#) would least likely be able to defend herself, and when it was least likely that anyone would witness any part of the act and attempt to intervene. ^pyze1  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) took multiple steps to decrease the chances that he would leave any forensic evidence for police to find. [^p-bnk]    
Further, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) used his own [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#) as props in his story to police, holding them forth as proof he did not venture out into the night and "kill the mother of his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#)". ^gq94k  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#)'s arrogance manifested itself in a belief that he was smarter than anyone else, and that if he just planned well enough he would be able to get away with murder. [^04ofs]   
It would appear, from all the evidence in the case, that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) approached this vicious attack like he would have any problem at work; this is, with enough thought and engineering anything could be managed. ^47qd7  
  
The manner in which [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) planned the attack, and the manner in which [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) carried himself in the days immediately following the discovery of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#)'s body in the bathtub demonstrates this. [^yn35i]    
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) believed he had thought of everything - coming under the cover of darkness, wearing protective gear, disposing of the various items used in the attack, and having a story he believed could not be not be disproved. ^p0yhj  
  
Ultimately, however, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) was undone both by various items he did not account for, and by his own unravelling when his "post-Susann" life did not turn out as he anticipated. ^nryjr  
  
The degree to which [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#)'s selfishness will impact the lives of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#)'s family and his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#) is hard to overstate. ^h64ie  
  
In an effort to keep his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#) from going with their mother to her native Germany, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) went to great lengths to defame a woman whom all evidence indicates devoted her life to her [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#) and church. ^966aa  
  
Because he feared that the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#) might be moved to Germany at some point, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) has essentially orphaned them. [^a3u58]    
  
The grotesque manner in which [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) treated [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) both during the attack and afterwards by leaving her in the bathtub, speaks volumes as to the disdain he had for anyone's desires or wishes other than his own. [^uzxsh]   
  
The horrific scene that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) left in blood at the home where his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#) lived would seem clear evidence [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) thought of no one but himself. ^8w53x  
  
The cold-blooded viciousness of the attack on [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) cannot be exaggerated. [^wdcrk]  
  
The Court saw the damage [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) inflicted on [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), so it will not be belaboured here. ^ysb0p  
  
However, the location of the injuries, the number of injuries she suffered, the use of two different weapons, and the placement of her in the bathtub once she was completely helpless demonstrates a single mindedness of purpose on [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#)'s part. [^wytqp]  
  
The pain and horror that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) likely suffered in her final moments is disturbing to contemplate. ^d7a-h  
  
The State would request that the Court impose the high end of the actual standard range of 344 months. ^m10d7  
  
The State would also ask that the Court impose 36 months of community custody after [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#)'s release, and impose the standard financial conditions. ^wphno  
  
The State would also ask the Court to order [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) to have no contact with Kristine Hentschel, Johanna and Werner Hentschel for life. ^5yw-0  
  
The State would also ask that the Court order no contact with either Noelani Smith and Felix Smith until they reach the age of 18, respectively. ^n708z

[Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#) and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#)  
  
The girlfriend of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#), the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#) man accused of killing his estranged wife early last year, died [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/36-2014-04-08-Monday-April-8th-2014](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/36-2014-04-08-Monday-April-8th-2014.md#) in [Seattle](geo:47.6038321,-122.330062). ^1lccy  
  
According to the King County Medical Examiner's Office, [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#) committed suicide.    
Marks around her neck indicate she died from a rope or something around her neck. ^oongz  
  
Thai lived at Pacific Court in [Tukwila](geo:47.4627356,-122.2559156). The [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#) manager could not confirm if [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#) had died in her home.  
  
[Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#) told the _Reporter_ in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/29-2013-07-July-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/29-2013-07-July-2013.md#) she was pregnant with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#)'s child and there was an ultrasound photo posted to her personal Facebook account around the same time. ^4148p    
The medical examiner's office could not confirm if [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was still pregnant at the time of her death. ^taqjm  
  
Lawyers for [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) asked a judge to push back his murder trial this week so they could have more time to prepare.    
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s trial date was moved from [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/40-2014-05-02-Friday-May-2nd-2014](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/40-2014-05-02-Friday-May-2nd%202014.md#) to [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/42-2014-06-13-Friday-June-13th-2014](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/42-2014-06-13-Friday-June-13th-2014.md#), according to Craig Matheson, senior deputy prosecuting attorney at Snohomish County Prosectors Office. ^hb6x1  
  
"While certainly tragic, I don't think [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s death will affect the trial at all," Matheson said.  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), who plead not guilty in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/29-2013-07-July-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/29-2013-07-July-2013.md#.md#), [is accused of killing his estranged wife](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/194405941.html) last February and sits in the Snohomish County Jail on $1 million bail. [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) is accused of murdering his wife [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#), who was found on[03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#), face down, beaten and drown to death in the bathtub of her [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#.md#) home while her two [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#) were away, according to court documents. She had defensive wounds on her hands and arms, a fractured skull, and 19 separate blunt force strikes, according to court documents. She had to be identified by her dental records.  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) [moved back into the home](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/204131081.html) with [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/14-2013-04-April-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/14-2013-04-April-2013.md#) and had hopes of regaining custody of his two young [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#), who had been taken by Washington State [Child Protective Services](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#). ^qdarf  
  
[Alan Smith and Thai seemed to have a rocky relationship](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/208901791.html) as police were called to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home for various incidents during May 2013, including a report of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) having sex in the front yard and for a domestic disturbance.  
  
[When Alan Smith was charged](http://www.bothell-reporter.com/news/213571071.html)[../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/28-2013-06-28-Friday-June-28th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/28-2013-06-28-Friday-June-28th-2013.md#), he said his life was in "chaos." He stated that he was over his head "with [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and her mental issues," according to charging documents. ^9wx16  
  
When [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) appeared in court [../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/31-2013-09-23-Monday-September-23rd-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/13-Investigation-Dates/31-2013-09-23-Monday-September-23rd-2013.md#) on a misdemeanor charge of obstruction, [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), was there to defend him. ^bt6bq    
At the time, the two lived together in the home where [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) was killed.  
  
"I feel absolutely safe — absolutely. We argue, we throw things, but we don't hurt each other," [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) said at the time.  
  
She also believed that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was capable of killing.  
  
"I don't know what his threshold is," she said. "Is the possibility and the capability there? Yes."  
  
But she said she was in love and trusted [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) completely.  
  
"He said he did not do it," [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) said. "So, I stand by him and the truth will always set people free."  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and his attorney could not be reached for comment.

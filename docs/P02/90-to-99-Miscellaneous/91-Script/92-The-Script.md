# The Script  
# Introduction  
  
Tuesday the 12th of February, 2013.[^1] - *odometer*  
  
[Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#), Washington State, the United States. - *bothell wide*  
  
A concerned co-worker contacted the local police after a 37 year old woman failed to show up for work for two days in a row.[^2] - *office stock, make it seem panicky*  
  
And when the authorities conducted a welfare check, they were met with a scene that made their deepest and darkest nightmares seem tame in comparison. - *cgi, the house.*  
  
The investigators found themselves grappling with a series of questions, each more unsettling that the last: the nature of the event, its inexplicable motive, and ultimately, who engineered Susann Smith's murder? - *talking head*  
  
# Lead up to Crime  
  
In the year [2009](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/11-Background-Dates/02-2009.md#), [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#) Smith and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#) were in love, married and had bought and moved into a house together in the 200 Block of 240th Street SW, [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#).[^3]   
  
Their life together seemed to have been going well, with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) finding work at the local [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#) plant as they raised their two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#).  
  
Though, the happy life that their friends and family saw from the outside had been riddled with issues consuming their relationship behind closed doors.  
  
So much so, that on Friday the 18th of November 2011, the couple filed for divorce.[^4]   
  
And on that same day, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) moved out of [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#) and into an [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#) in [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#).[^5]   
  
The separated couple then spent months trying to both reach a share agreement[^462]  about the kids, though, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#) were unable to find resolve on all the parenting issues.[^463]   
  
You see, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) wanted to have a 50/50 share plan, but [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#) felt that such a plan would've been far too disruptive for their two young kids.[^464]   
  
And when it became clear that they would be unable to reach an agreement, Alan hired an attorney and filed a Motion for Temporary order.[^465]   
  
On Friday the 3rd of August 2012, a hearing took place regarding the custody which included a temporary parenting plan that had been submitted by [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)[^6] - which is essentially an agreement that contains information about where your child will live and how you and the other parents will care for your child/[children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#) during the divorce proceedings, the temporary plan lasting until the divorce is finalized and the permanent parenting plan is in place.[^7]   
  
One of the issues that was raised during this hearing had been that Alan had moved to the Ravenna neighbourhood of Seattle and the Commissioner felt that the commute to Bothell for the young children simply didn't make a lot of sense.[^466]   
  
Ultimately, though, the [Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#) of this hearing largely adopted the plan submitted by [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) , which had been in [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s favour.[^8]   
  
After the hearing, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had what was described as a disagreement about who would be spending time with their [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#) during the summer, with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) growing increasingly angry.[^9] [^10]   
  
[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s divorce attorney, a man called [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#), took note of this disagreement especially when [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) became fixed on [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) with what he described as an "*incredibly angry*" stare that lasted about five or so seconds.[^11]   
  
This stare had been something the like [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had never seen in his some 15 years of practise, and it had been concerning enough to [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#) that he actually asked [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) about it afterwards, and mentioned it to his staff.[^12]   
  
A couple of weeks after this hearing, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) effectively fired his attorney[^467]  and hired a new one on the 21st of September 2012.[^468]   
  
Also in September of 2012, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) actually began dating a different woman by the name of [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Rachel-Amrine.md#).[^13]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) hadn't been shy of making his thoughts and opinions known about the divorce and about [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) to his new girlfriend Rachel, with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) asking during one angry rant to Rachel: "*how could he make someone disappear without anyone knowing*".[^14]   
  
Several days after that angry rant, in an angry phone call, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) told Rachel that he "*just wanted her to be done with*" - presumably referring to the mother of his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#), [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^15]   
  
In another discussion between [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and Rachel, Rachel mentioned that one of her friends who had been in the military had once told her how you could beat someone with a phone book and not leave any bruising[^16] , to which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) replied "*you could do that with a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#) too*".[^17]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) would often "rant and rant" about [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) to Rachel, getting heated about the amount of child support he was paying, and his fear that she would attempt to move their two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to Germany.[^18]   
  
On one notable occasion, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) told Rachel that he would like to just get rid of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and asked her if she knew of any way of making that happen without anyone knowing and Rachel responded, in what she would later claim to have been a joking manner, that they could use potassium chloride or a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#.md#) to kill someone.[^19]   
  
When [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) once again mentioned his desire for [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) to disappear, Rachel began to grow very concerned that this wasn't a dark joke anymore and she began to wonder whether or not [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) was serious about it.[^20]   
  
On Sunday the 27th of October, 2012, financial records showed that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had visited a Home Depot store and purchased a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#.md#.md#), two packs of [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#) Chemical Splash Resistant [Coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#), and disposable shoe covers[^21] - the nature of this purchase especially following his conversations with Rachel became a major cause of concern for her.  
  
On the 7th of November 2012, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) fired the 2nd attorney that he'd hired for the divorce proceedings and hired a 3rd attorney.[^469]   
  
And at some point in November of 2012, Rachel helped [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) move from an [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#) that he was living in Seattle to an [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#) in [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#) - the same place where Susan lived.[^22]   
  
We do know that on Saturday the 24th of November 2012, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) purchased a [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#) for $616 from Gregg's Green Lake in Seattle.[^23]   
  
And at some point before the end of that November month, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and Rachel separated.[^24]   
  
On Thursday the 13th of December, 2012, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) filed paperwork relating to his divorce that claimed he now believed [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been sexually assaulting their two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^25]   
  
[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s attorney [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#) found this new claim to have been very odd as [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had failed to mentioned these concerns about [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s parenting previously.[^470]   
  
These filings had been as part of a motion to reconsider a failure by [the Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#.md#) to order a GAL, or Guardian AD Litem[^26] [^27], appointed to the case.[^28]   
  
> [!note]    
> According to Snohomish County's website, a Guardian ad Litem, or GAL, when talking about family law is a person or persons that are appointed to represent the best interests of a child/[children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), an alleged incapacitated person, or a person in a minor settlement case, for specific purposes and specific periods of time, or in conflict cases when the Court needs information from a neutral source.    
> Under the direction of the Court, the GAL performs an investigation and prepares a report. GALs do not act as lawyers, therapists, or parties in the case, and therefor do not provide legal advise, counselling, or diagnosis.

> In some divorce and child custody cases in Washington State, a specially-trained guardian ad litem (GAL) is assigned to the case by the court to investigate and determine what the best interests of the child or [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) is.

As soon as [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s attorney, [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#.md#), heard of the nature of this filing - he was absolutely outraged.[^29]   
  
On the 3rd of December 2012, a Commissioner heard [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s motion to appoint a GAL and found no evidence that it was warranted[^471]  and actually awarded [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) $500 in attorney fees as a result of having to defend the motion.[^472]   
  
But [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) wasn't done.  
  
He filed a Motion for Reconsideration which is basically a request for it to be looked at again to the Commissioner on the 13th of December 2012.[^473]   
  
Though, this time, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) provided a declaration in which he claimed he had been to a psychiatrist and reported his own observations and concerns.[^474]   
  
He claimed that as a result of his discussions, the psychiatrist had raised concerns that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) may have been sexually abusing their 6 year old daughter.[^475]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) stated:[^476]   
  
>[!quote] [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in his declaration   
>*Susann is very much in need of psychiatric evaulation and the children need to be protected.*  
  
[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s attorney [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#) believed at the time that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) was engaging in double hearsay with no real evidence and to [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), this showed how outrageous [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had become in trying to convince the court[^477] - he felt that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had been willing to do anything to try and get the court to listen to him.[^478]  
  
And due to the holiday season quickly approaching, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) would have to live with these allegations until after the New Year came around before seeing if the courts would believe her or her soon to be ex-husband which likely would've caused her a lot of stress. (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
The courts finally addressed the motion on Thursday the 10th of January 2013, with [the Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#.md#) denying the motion. [^30]  
  
Following this hearing for the motion, Susan actually sent an email to her attorney [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in which she stated that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had called her with a proposal to "give his children their family back" [^479] and that essentially, he wanted to move back in.[^480]   
  
To [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), this indicated that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had been making up stories about her in an effort to win in court.[^32] [^481]   
  
[John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) asked why a person who truly believed that his wife had been sexually abusing their daughter would turn around in a couple of weeks and try to reconcile with his wife.[^482]   
  
The following day, on Friday the 11th of January 2013, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) filed a Motion of Revision of [the Commissioner](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/03-Commissioner.md#.md#)'s Ruling on the GAL - which essentially meant he appealed the ruling against his allegations.[^33]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) also proceeded to file papers that indicated that he was scared that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) might move the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to her native country of Germany, which would prevent him from seeing his [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^34]   
  
On Friday the 25th of January, 2013, a hearing was held in regards to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s motion of revision in front of a judge called [Judge Fair](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/04-Judge-Fair.md#), and [Judge Fair](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/04-Judge-Fair.md#) ultimately found there to have been no merit to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s accusations, and once again ruled in [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s favour.[^35]   
  
According to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s attorney, [John Ely](../../70-to-79-People/77-Legal-Teams/02-John-Ely.md#.md#.md#.md#), after this hearing took place, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been waiting in the hall outside the courtroom when she was approached by [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) who called her a "*monster*".[^36]   
  
A business trip had been scheduled by [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) for [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) to travel to Ireland with two of his co-workers, [Matthew Pierce](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Matthew-Pierce.md#) and [Colin Warner](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/02-Colin-Warner.md#), departing on Monday the 4th of February 2013.[^37]   
  
On this trip, according to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s co-worker Matthew, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) talked almost exclusively about his divorce.[^38]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) ranted and raved that the court hearings were not going in his favour and detailed his anger about it, blaming the court system as one that had been rigged to favour women and that it was all a conspiracy to take all of his money from him[^39] - [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) told Matthew that the courts were a "*fixed system*".[^40]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s co-workers would later estimate that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) would change the topic of conversation while on this trip to Ireland to be about his family problems at least 60-70% of the time.[^41]   
  
His other co-worker, Colin, would later describe a conversation that he had with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) on the Ireland trip in which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) commented "*I want her to know the pain I feel*" - talking about [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^42]   
  
Colin would also later explain how [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) told him that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been mentally abusive towards him, and apparently used to treat their dog poorly.[^43]   
  
[Matthew Pierce](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/04-Matthew-Pierce.md#.md#) later revealed that he was told by [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) several times that his wife, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#), was "*pure evil*" and called her a "*psychopath*".[^44]   
  
This kind of conversation about [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s divorce hadn't been unusual at all for [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#), as according to Matthew, in the two or three years that he had known [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#), the majority of their conversations had centred around [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s divorce and his wife.[^45]   
  
The business trip to Ireland wrapped up on Wednesday the 6th of February 2013, with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) returning home to Washington on Saturday the 9th - arriving at the airport at midday.[^46]   
  
After departing the airport, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) drove over to [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#) which was where [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) lived to pick up the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) as it had been his turn to have custody, arriving at the house at about 2pm.  
  
[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had actually been hosting a Fasching party that afternoon, which is a German carnival celebration described as being the German version of Mardi Gras, and a number of [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) from the local neighbourhood had been there at the Smith house as part of this party.[^47]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) stuck around at this party, seemingly to allow his two [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to enjoy the festivities, and actually went inside the Smith house.[^48]   
  
He went into the kitchen, two of the bedrooms, the hallway, the bathroom and the living room.[^49]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) also took his son into the restroom while he was at the house[^50] , before leaving with both [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) at about 2:30pm.[^51]   
  
This party would be, according to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), the last time that he saw [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) alive.[^52]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) claimed that he spent the following day, Sunday the 10th of February 2013, with his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^53]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had gone to church that Sunday morning at about 9am with the kids, dropping the children off at the church's day care before carrying out his responsibilities as part of the greeting team for the 9:30am service.[^179]   
  
The church service lasted for about an hour and a half before [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) went with a group of his fellow church-goers to donate blood, however, he was unsuccessful in his blood donation due to his blood clotting.[^179]   
  
After he donated blood, he went out with the group for lunch at the Rock in Lynnwood.[^179]   
  
Financial records did indicate that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had visited [Canyon Park QFC](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/03-Canyon-Park-QFC.md#)[^54] , which is a supermarket[^55] , that day.  
  
While it is not corroborated by official sources, it seems reasonable to infer that he likely needed to grab some groceries and supplies for himself and his [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) after spending the week in Ireland on business (**note: this is the author's inference**).  
  
That Sunday evening, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) watched movies at his [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#) with his [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)  and then they had all slept there at his apartment. [^53]   
  
[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#), that day, used her time away from her [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to catch up with some of her friends.[^56]   
  
That Sunday, she spoke with a friend from Germany over the phone before heading to choir practice.[^57]   
  
After which [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) met up with her friend Ani to go to see Music Man in Seattle.[^58]   
  
[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) and Ani had met up at the theatre, the 5th Avenue Theater, and settled into their seats ready for the show to start at 7pm.[^59] [^60]   
  
After the show, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) dropped Ani back off at her home and then returned to [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#) sometime before 10:30pm.[^61]   
  
It had been at around this tame time that one of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s neighbours, a [Mr Buckley](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/07-Mr-Buckley.md#), returned back home with his daughter and saw [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) standing outside the front of [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^62]   
  
[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) saw [Mr Buckley](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/07-Mr-Buckley.md#.md#) and headed over to talk to him - the conversation had been quick, after which Susan returned back to her home. [^63]   
  
Though, Susan didn't go straight to bed when she got back home.[^64]   
  
Instead, she turned on her computer and access the internet[^65] , logging in to her online banking account[^66] before going to Netflix[^67] to watch a show or movie (**note: this is the author's inference**).  
  
By 11:35pm, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had still been watching Netflix.[^68]   
  
That had been the last known movement of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).  
  
# Crime  
  
On Monday the 11th of February 2013, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) failed to show up for work, and failed to answer phone calls from work who were trying to find out if she had been running late or if she had any other reason for not showing up.[^69]   
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) dropped off the two [kids](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) at the day care that morning[^70] , and picked them up after he had finished his shift at the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) plant.[^71]   
  
According to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#), he and the [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) spent that night at [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^72]   
  
The following day, on Tuesday the 12th of February 2013, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) failed to show up to work for the second day in a row.[^73]   
  
Efforts were made by her co-workers and employer to get a hold of Susan, but to no avail.[^74]   
  
This failure to show up for work and failure to answer phone calls was completely out of character and described as being highly unusual for [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^75]   
  
And so, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s co-workers contacted the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#) Police Department and informed them that she had not shown up for work[^76] and that they were concerned for her wellbeing. (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
The police subsequently carried out a welfare check on [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^77]   
  
Officers arrived at [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home for the welfare check at approximately 11:30am[^78] - though it must be noted that earlier reports detail them arriving an hour earlier at about 10:30am[^79] , but we shall be using the timings of the later reports - and when they arrived, they knocked on the door of the Smith house but received no response from inside.[^80]   
  
The officers then decided to walk around the home and peer in through the windows[^81] to see whether they could see any indication that anyone had been home. (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
And it was while they were looking in through the window of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s bedroom that they saw significant amounts of blood on the floor and on the wall.[^82]   
  
The officers then returned to the front of the house and tried the front door, which had been unlocked, and entered the Smith house.[^83]   
  
As the officers started moving through the house, they noticed suspected bloody footprints in the kitchen and a hallway which ran the length of the left half of the residence.[^483]   
  
They noticed that the amount of suspected blood increased substantially as the hallway stretched into the threshold of the bedroom - which had been the same bedroom that they had peered into through the window from outside.[^484]   
  
Inside the bathroom of the family home, they discovered that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), a 37 year old mother of two, had been murdered in what they described to have been a particularly brutal fashion[^84] in the bathtub of her home.[^85]   
  
The Washington State Patrol Crime Scene Response Team, or CRST, was contacted to assist in processing the crime scene[^86] who wouldn't arrived until later that evening[^87] .   
  
An axe was located in the corner of the dining room area of the house that was taken into evidence as a suspected weapon.[^486]   
  
Based on the blood splatter evidence, it had become apparent that Susan had initially been attacked while she had been in her bed.[^88]   
  
The attack then moved to the floor between the bed and the wall[^89] , which had extensive blood pooling, smearing and splattering.[^90]   
  
It was apparent that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been rendered defenceless while on the floor, with bloody drag marks leading from the floor down the hall and into the bathroom.[^91]   
  
Inside the bathroom, [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body lay face down[^92] in the bathtub which had been full of water.[^93]   
  
[Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been clothed only in a grey t-shirt[^94] , and her body temperature had been consistent with her having been in the tub for multiple days.[^95]   
  
Horrifically, due to the injuries that Susan had sustained to her face, the police had been initially unable to positively identify her.[^96]   
  
During the processing of the home, the police discovered a number of footprints left in blood in various locations in the house.[^97]   
  
Some of these bloody footprints appeared to have been of a bare foot showing through a blood soaked sock, some of them appeared to have been that of a shoed foot - a shoe which had a distinct pattern on the sole -, and some of them appeared to have been that of a foot wearing some sort of covering that left a distinct patterned impression in the blood.[^98]   
  
On the bathtub itself, the police discovered several bloody transfer impressions with a very distinct pattern.[^99]   
  
It appeared that these bloody transfer impressions did not have any ridge detail, which indicated that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s killer had been wearing gloves at the time.[^100]   
  
It also appeared that at least some preliminary efforts at cleaning up the crime scene had been attempted.[^101]   
  
Notably, the police found no signs of forced entry[^102] , and no murder weapons at the crime scene.[^103]   
  
There had been no evidence that the Smith home had been ransacked or searched[^104] , with various items such as laptops, smart phones and TV's that would commonly be stolen in a burglary being left untouched. [^105]    
  
This led the investigators to conclude that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been targeted.[^106]   
  
# Investigation  
  
A full scale homicide investigation was launched, with [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) and [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#) quickly arriving on the scene. (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
The detectives quickly learnt from speaking with the neighbours of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) that she had an estranged husband called [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), and that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) worked at the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) plant in Everett[^107], and that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) currently lived in the house with her two small children.[^485]   
  
The authorities established that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had lived about 10 minutes away from [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home via car[^487] , and that they shared two small children who had been in [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s care over the weekend who had been dropped off at day care that morning.[^488]   
  
Both of the children were contacted and were determined to have been safe.[^489]   
  
[Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#) spoke with two neighbours to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house, Mark Buckley and Oksana Gutnikov, who had both attended the children's party at [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house the Saturday prior.[^490]   
  
They explained that the only other adults at the party had been [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)[^491] , though [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) didn't actually attended the party and only showed up at the end to pick up their children.[^492]   
  
Both Oksana Gutnikov and Mark Buckley stated that they never saw [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) leave the living room of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house that day[^493] , though, they both had left the party while [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had still been inside.[^494]   
  
And so [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) and [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#) decided to pay [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) a visit.  
  
At approximately 2pm, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#), [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#) and uniformed Office Caban left [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#) for the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) Plant.[^108]   
  
En route, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) contact [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) Security Office Brian Ferguson and requested a meeting with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^109]   
  
He detailed the purpose of the visit to both inform [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) that his wife appeared to have been murdered, that his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were safe, and to see if [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) appeared to have any injuries that may have been associated with the murder, and to find out [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s whereabouts at relevant times to the crime.[^110]   
  
The two detectives and the uniformed officer arrived at the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) plant at about 2:45pm.[^111] [^112]   
  
Upon their arrival, they were escorted into one of [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#)'s conference rooms by security[^113] and, shortly thereafter, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was also escorted into the conference room.[^114]   
  
[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) introduced himself and [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#) to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and told him that they would like to talk with him.[^115]   
  
Strangely, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) failed to ask the detectives what exactly the purpose of their visit had been about.[^495]   
  
It's important to note that the uniformed officer was seated in the far corner of the conference room and had no interaction with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)[^116] directly, while [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) sat at the head of the conference table[^117] with the two detectives who had been dressed in plain clothes.[^118]   
  
The detectives informed [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) that they were investigating a serious crime, but importantly that his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were safe[^119] , before telling [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) that they had located a dead body at [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^120]   
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) then proceeded to give the police his first account of his activities over the past several days, which included when he claimed to have last seen [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) and the state of the pending divorce.[^121]   
  
After [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) disclosed this account, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) attempted to press [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) further and mentioned that divorce and child custody hearings could be very emotional, asking [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) whether he had any reason to harm [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^122]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) did not answer the detective.[^123]   
  
So, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) asked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) the question again.[^124]   
  
To which, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) said: "*I think I may need to talk to an attorney.*"[^125]   
  
It was at that point that [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) informed [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) that he was not under arrest, and [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) indicated that he understood what the detective was saying.[^126]   
  
Now, it's important to note that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) did not ask these detectives as to whose body had been found[^127] , and according to the two detectives, it seemed as if [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s reaction had been rehearsed.[^128]   
  
They also made note of the fact that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) didn't ask what the crime was nor did he ask where his children were[^497] , and that he struggled with his timeline of events for the Sunday evening into Monday morning.[^496]   
  
It was at this point that the detectives took note of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s obviously swollen left hand and a cut that he had sustained to his left thumb.[^129]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) explained that his three year old son had struck his hand with a hatchet while cutting firewood, and that his son had hit him without warning.[^499]   
  
To the detectives, the injury looked like the result of a contusion from blunt force trauma.[^498]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) then explained that the reason he had a band aid over his left thumb had been due to the fact that he had accidentally cut himself while cutting an apple earlier that morning at home.[^500]   
  
Further abrasions on his knuckles of his right hand that had been almost healed[^501]  were noted by the investigators, with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) explaining that he always seemed to cut himself.[^502]   
  
The detectives asked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) whether they could take photographs of his hands, to which he agreed.[^130]   
  
It was immediately obvious based on comparing both hands that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s left hand had been swollen.  
  
[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) then excused himself and stepped away from the conference room to call the assigned prosecutor, and they decided that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) was not going to be detained at that time and that he was free to go.[^131]   
  
The interview in the conference room came to an end at approximately 4:30pm[^132] , with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) agreeing to let the detectives drive him back to his building where his [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#) had been parked.[^133]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) sat in the back of the police vehicle as they drove to his building[^134] , with no further questioning taking place.[^135]   
  
When they arrived at his building, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) went inside and retrieved his laptop and backpack.[^136]   
  
And as he was doing so, the detectives placed another call to the assigned prosecutor and it was subsequently determined that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) would be placed with child protective services, or [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#), until [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had been cleared in the homicide investigation. [^137]   
  
When [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) left his office building, the detectives informed him that his [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were going into [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#) until further notice[^138] , to which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) responded with: "I guess I'll have to live with that."[^503]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) didn't ask how his children were, or where they were, or even how to contact them.[^504]   
  
It wasn't until the detectives told [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) the steps to take to reach [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#) that he asked about the welfare of his two young children[^505]  - with detectives telling [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) that the [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#.md#) paperwork could be retrieved at [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#) Police Department.[^138]  
  
The detectives handed [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) directions to the police department so he could pick up the paperwork.[^139]  
  
And this ended the first initial police contact with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^140]   
  
At approximately 5:00pm, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) contacted the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#) Police Department to let them know that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) would be enroute to them to get the [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#.md#.md#) paperwork.[^141]   
  
Shortly before [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) arrived at the police department, he actually left a message on [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#)'s voicemail in which he asked whether the police wanted to look around his [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) or take a [DNA](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/05-DNA.md#) sample. [^142] [^143]   
  
>[!note] Editor's Note  
>The following quote displayed on screen as the previous paragraph is spoken:  
>  
>"*Hello [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#), this is [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), uh, who you just interviewed today. Uhm, I wo…so I'm at the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#) Police Station. I wonder if you would like for me to let you into my [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to have a look around or anything else you might need from..a..[DNA](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/05-DNA.md#.md#) sample, I don't know if you need a blood sample or something like that. You're welcome to those. So, if you get a chance, call me back as soon as you can. Thanks. Bye.*"  
  
The detective wouldn't hear this message until two days later, on the 14th of February, when he checked his voicemail but as you'll soon find out, it didn't matter all too much.[^144]   
  
At 6:00pm, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) arrived at the police department and entered the front lobby.[^145]   
  
A member of staff and [Detective Thompson](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/07-Detective-Thompson.md#) met with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and together they went over the [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) paperwork.[^146]   
  
It was during this conversation that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) told them that his [car](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/05-Car.md#.md#) had been parked outside and that the police could search it and his [apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) if they wanted to.[^147]   
  
[Detective Thompson](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/07-Detective-Thompson.md#) explained that there were forms [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) would have to sign if that was what he wanted, and [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) indicated that he'd be fine with that.[^148]   
  
Detective Stone was then contacted at 6:35pm and informed of Alan's consent for a search[^149] , with Detective Stone and Detective Chissus arriving back at the Bothell Police Department at 6:55pm to meet with Alan to go through the paperwork.[^150]   
  
Alan wrote this brief statement in which he indicated that he was initiating contact with detectives and that he did not need the presence of his lawyer while the police inspected his car and apartment. (on screen: [(3.5 MEMORANDUM).pdf > page=12](../../../assets/attachments/05_13-1-01546-8_37_3_5_MEMORANDUM.pdf))[^151]   
  
Detective Stone then went over the Ferrier consent form with Alan, which he signed. (on screen: [(3.5 MEMORANDUM).pdf > page=14](../../../assets/attachments/05_13-1-01546-8_37_3_5_MEMORANDUM.pdf))[^152]   
  
And the search of Alan Smith's car began at approximately 7:00pm.[^153]   
  
During the search, the police located a plastic bag from Home Depot that contained two further unopened bags of Kleenguard Chemical Splash Resistant Coveralls.[^155] [^156]   
  
They also located a roll of tape[^157] , an unopened box of Playtex brand latex gloves, a new 5 gallon gas container[^158]  and a portable Garmin GPS on the front dash.[^159]   
  
A brief conversation ensued in which Alan Smith stated that he had been planning on painting an "*accent*" wall in his apartment to justify the coveralls and the roll of tape.[^154] [^160]   
  
At the conclusion of the search of his car, Alan was asked by the detectives if he would still consent to a search of his apartment[^161] , which he agreed to.[^162]   
  
Alan Smith then drove himself to his apartment, followed closely by Detective Stone and Detective Chissus[^163]  - with the trio arriving there at approximately 7:30pm.[^164]   
  
A number of detectives also arrived at Alan's apartment shortly thereafter to assist in the search.[^165]   
  
And Alan Smith read and signed a consent to search form at 7:26pm.[^166] (on screen: [(3.5 MEMORANDUM).pdf > page=16](../../../assets/attachments/05_13-1-01546-8_37_3_5_MEMORANDUM.pdf))  
  
The search was conducted while [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) sat at the dining room table. [^506]   
  
In the spare bedroom off the living room, [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#) noticed about ten separate neat stacks of paper placed on the floor[^507]  - the stacks were very orderly and the room itself had been void of furniture and furnishings.[^508]   
  
[Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#) also noticed that a fair amount of the paper appeared to be related to the divorce proceedings and child custody issues.[^509]   
  
During the course of the search of his apartment, Alan Smith apparently spoke with two of the detectives and discussed a number of topics but its unclear what exactly they spoke about.[^167]   
  
At about 8:40pm, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) mentioned that he was willing to volunteer a buccal swab for DNA purposes[^169]  , which he did without being prompted by the police.[^170]   
  
The investigators accepted his offer and subsequently obtained two separate DNA samples of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s saliva.[^171]   
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) then sat down with [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#) and [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) in his [Apartment](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/06-Apartment.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and gave a taped statement at 8:42pm.[^172]   
  
In this taped statement, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) was asked to describe where he and Susann first met, to which he described that they had met in 1999 when he had been attending the University of Colorado Boulder.[^173]

>On screen screenshot of [02-3_5-Memorandum](../../20-to-29-Case-Files/21-File-Notes/02-3_5-Memorandum.md#hdrwj) reply.  
  
According to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#), [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been a foreign exchange student from Germany as he had been getting his undergrad and after they had met, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had learned German.[^174]   
  
He went on to explain that he had wanted to go experience a little bit of Germany, which he did.[^175]   
  
Firstly, he got a job in Austria but had been unable to afford the bills so ended up going to Germany for a while and worked there.[^176]   
  
After which, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) went on what [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) described as a world tour and ultimately ended up in the United States in the [Bothell](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/05-Bothell.md#) area in 2009.[^177] [^178]  
  
When [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) was asked about his relationship with [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#), [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) said that it was complicated and that they had communication troubles, detailing that there had been fights in front of the kids that ultimately led to separation.[^180]   
  
>[!note] Editor's Note  
>On screen screenshot of [02-3_5-Memorandum](../../20-to-29-Case-Files/21-File-Notes/02-3_5-Memorandum.md#fb3ix) reply.  
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) also revealed to the investigators that he and [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had tried couples counselling though it hadn't helped and ultimately [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) ended up moving out of the family home.[^181]   
  
He confirmed that he moved out of [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) in November of 2011 and moved into an apartment in the North Creek area of Bothell.[^182]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) explained that his relationship with [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) at that point had been collegial and rather formal.[^183]   
  
The detectives then inquired as to the state of the divorce proceedings to which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) detailed that there had been a parenting plan in place and that they were nearing finalising the divorce, though they hadn't set up a date for mediation as of that point.[^184]   
  
[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) asked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) when the last time was that he spoke to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#), and [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) stated that he spoke to her on the Saturday of the Fasching party at the house and that conversation had been the last time.[^185] [^186]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) told the detectives that he had been picking up the children[^187]  and that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been having a party with some of her friends as part of the Fasching celebrations.[^188]   
  
He described how the children had costumes on and that there had been a big construction project in the living room.[^189]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) explained that he had been at the party for about half an hour, and had been keeping an eye on the kids who had been running back and forth throughout the house into the bedrooms and hallways.[^190]   
  
He made sure to state to the police that he had been play wrestling with his son in the hallway and in the living room[^510]  and that his hair might be found in the home because of this wrestling with his son who had pulled on his hair.[^511]   
  
When the party came to an end at 2:30pm[^193] , [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) described that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) almost whisked him and the children out of the door so that she could start cleaning.[^191]   
  
But before doing that, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) (according to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)) asked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) to take a jacket and some other clothing across the street to Mark Buckley as his daughter had left a few things at the house.[^192]   
  
Besides the children at this party, the only other adults present that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) recalled had been Mark Buckley and another neighbour by the name of Oksana.[^194]   
  
[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) then inquired as to when [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had moved into the house, which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) responded to by stating that they had moved in shortly after their son was born - settling on December 2009.[^195]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) was then asked whether [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had any other male companions that he knew of, perhaps anyone who would've been present at the party.[^197]   
  
He responded by saying that he had suspected that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) and the neighbour Mark had been dating for a while but [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had told him that they hadn't been dating, and that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) hadn't introduced [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) to any of her boyfriends and on the flip side he hadn't introduced [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) to any of his girlfriends.[^196]   
  
[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#)'s tone turned more serious as he asked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#): do you know anybody who would want to harm her?[^198]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) said that he didn't know.[^199]   
  
The detectives posed a theoretical, asking if he had been them; where would he start to look.[^200]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) hesitated for a moment before stating that on that Sunday [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) would've been at church so he would expect maybe someone with the choir.[^201]   
  
He told the investigators that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had attended the same church that they both attended when they had still been together, but that he didn't attend it anymore.[^202] [^203]   
  
It was at this point that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) reiterated that Mark and Oksana were a good place to start.[^204]   
  
The interview then pivoted back to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s relationship to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#), with [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) asking whether [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had been paying child support.[^205]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) confirmed that he did, estimating that he paid roughly eleven hundred monthly.[^206]   
  
The detectives asked for more details about the child support payments which saw [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) end up upping the estimate of how much he paid to close to two thousand a month.[^207]   
  
When [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) was asked whether [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been working, and what she worked as, his answer had been a bit all over the place - though, he eventually clarified that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been doing translating work.[^208]   
  
Now it must be noted that during the police search of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s apartment, they located a hatchet which the detectives took a strong interest in.[^210]   
  
[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) asked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) about the hatchet, and asked him whether he had sustained an injury of any kind.[^209]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) responded by saying that he had swelling in his left hand where his son had hit him, across the meat of his hand and up into the knuckle of the middle finger[^212]  with the hatchet.[^213]   
  
[Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#) asked if they could re-create the incident, to which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) agreed to do.[^512]   
  
He was handed a piece of firewood and asked to hold it exactly how he had done at the time.[^513]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) held the firewood on the table with his hand palming the top portion of the wood.  [^514]   
  
He then indicated that his 3 year old son had hit him on the back of his hand with the hatchet turned backward[^515]  - a portion that is similar to a hammer.[^516]   
  
[Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#) raised the hatched and gently brought it down, hammer side, on to the back of his hand[^517]  - and [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) agreed that was how it had happened.[^518]   
  
Though to the detectives, the swelling on the back of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s hand did not appear to be consistent with that kind of injury[^519] , there was no distinct marking consistent with the circular hammer portion of the hatchet[^520] , and notably; the hatchet appeared to have been a heavy tool for a 3 year old to be able to hold yet alone use.[^521]   
  
The detectives took note of this observation, before [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#) revisited the line of questioning concerning whether [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been dating anybody.[^211]   
  
He asked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) whether [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) would've told him if she had been dating, to which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) said that she wouldn't have as [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) didn't feel that it's appropriate for him to introduce his girlfriends to her and that he wouldn't expect her to.  
  
Though, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) then went back on himself and explained that he had introduced one previous girlfriend before but that it had been awkward.  
  
The investigators then went through [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s dating history with him[^214] , with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) revealing that he'd dated three women since the separation though none for very long.[^215] [^216] [^217]   
  
It's interesting to note that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) failed to mention his relationship with [Rachel Amrine](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/05-Rachel-Amrine.md#.md#) to the investigators at this point  (**note: this is the author's inference**).  
  
[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) then asked a pivotal question: how do you feel if something's happened to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^218]  
  
Let's take a look at [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s response:[^219]   
  
> [!quote] [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)  
> Oh uhm.. as... if something happened to me.. uhm.. I.. uh.. angry and despondent.. hurt.. hurt.. (*pause*) confused, really... uh... kind of scared, really scared. I mean.. if... something happened to her, something could happen to me and what's going to happen to my kids? That's really just... what... I... I really.. am... scared for my kids right now. Uhm.. just.. oh.. just like.. terror imaging (**sp: imagining**) something happening to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).  
  
This is just my own opinion but I find it very interesting and curious that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) focuses his response on his own wellbeing, and overall lacks any concern for his ex-wife.  (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) then asked what [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) what he thought had happened to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^220]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) responded by stating that they hadn't told him anything yet, though he was aware that there was a lot of interest in the hatchet which, to him, suggested a lot of violence.[^221]   
  
[Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#.md#) quickly clarified that their interest in the hatchet had been due to the injury that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had sustained[^222] , which seemingly took [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) by surprise  (**note: this is the author's inference**).[^223]   
  
[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) then asked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) who he thought was in [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home[^224]  and reiterated that they had told him that they believed there to be a dead body - asking [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) who he thought it was.[^225]   
  
This is what [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) responded:[^226]   
  
> [!quote] [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)    
> I... I feel that.. I feel that it's [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).  
>  
  
When asked why he thought that[^227] , he said:[^228]   
  
> [!quote] [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)  
> It just.. it f.. I mean.. because.. she hasn't been to work, I haven't heard from her and I mean.. I.. I don't see her having a lot of people overnight uhm.. and I could be.. I could be wrong but if there's.. if there was one person staying overnight then where's [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)? And I sent her an email yesterday and she didn't respond. I mean, I wasn't really.. requesting a response but uhm.. I don't know.. I.. I'm tempted to text her but.. I don't know if that's..  
  
The interview then changed its focus once more to the vehicles that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) owned, with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) confirming that he drove a dark blue[^230]  year 2000[^231]  Mercedes[^229]  ML320[^232]  - which is like an SUV.[^233]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) also revealed that he also had a Honda Magna[^234]  2002 motorcycle that he had bought used.[^235]   
  
It was at this point in the interview that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) explained that he had a bicycle that had been stolen when he had lived at his other apartment[^236] in Ravenna.[^239]   
  
He stated that he hadn't reported it stolen[^237] , and that it had been a Jamis Zenith street bike.[^238]   
  
The detectives were unable to locate the bicycle described by [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) in any of their searches of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s apartment, [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house or nearby.[^600]   
  
Though, they did later learn from [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s co-workers that he had been an avid bicyclist.[^601]   
  
The interview at [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s apartment concluded at 9:35pm[^240] , after which the police bade [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) good night and left.[^241]   
  
Now weirdly, and we'll come back to this later on, but at 10:23pm, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) actually texted [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s phone saying just: "Hi Susie".[^242]   
  
That text message, as we'll touch on later, was very very odd.[^243]   
  
As this interview and the apartment search had been taking place, the Washington State Patrol Crime Scene Response Team, or CSRT, had arrived at [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) (arriving at about 8pm) to begin processing the crime scene which took them several days.[^244]   
  
The CSRT processed the blood stains, footwear and footprint impressions that had been left throughout the house.[^245]   
  
There had been several very clear footprint and footwear impressions left in the blood matrix in several locations in the house.[^246]   
  
Starting from the front door, the CSRT identified a single droplet of blood at the front entry way just inside the door.[^523]   
  
They determined that it could've been possible it had come from wet blood dripping off of blood-soaked items such as clothing or weapons being removed from the scene by the suspect, but that it was equally possible it could've come from blood from a fresh wound that the suspect had sustained.[^524]   
  
It was a notable finding due to the fact that it had been found in an area where there had been no other bloodstains present, and that it had been a symmetrical bloodstain which meant its width was equal to its length indicating that it was deposited from directly above the floor.[^525]   
  
This supported the hypothesis that the blood could've come from the suspect as they were leaving the crime scene, and the CSRT noted that just that one bit of evidence could contain the DNA profile of the suspect in the case - emphasising the importance that it is analysed.[^526]   
  
Blood smearing was identified on the inside and outside of the doorknob of the front door[^527] , with samples being collected for analysis.[^528]   
  
The CSRT identified several foot impressions in the home including in the hallway, kitchen, dining room and living room that tested positive for the presence of blood[^529]  - those foot impressions were also consistent in shape and size, likely being from just one person.[^530]   
  
A multitude of photographs were taken of the bloody footprints.[^248]   
  
It was also concluded by the CSRT that the foot impressions had been from a soft sole shoe or some type of soft material such as a sock or shoe cover with a waffle type pattern.[^531]   
  
Blood splatter, blood cast off, and other types of blood evidence were documented, both as they had been found initially and then as different pieces of furniture were removed to fully reveal the blood evidence.[^247]   
  
In the bathroom, the CSRT processed the scene in which the body was found in the bathtub full of water.[^532]   
  
The sides of the bath tub and the floor of the bathroom did not have any water or residue staining which indicated that the tub hadn't been full of water prior to the body being put in it.[^533]   
  
They also identified and collected a number of hairs from the victim's right hand and other parts of her body.[^534]   
  
CSRT located blood transfer staining from some material that had been left on the front edge of the bath tub[^535]  which they determined to have been from a material with a small woven pattern of equally squared shapes consistent with an article of clothing or soft fabric.[^536]   
  
The CSRT further took a large number of swabs from various bloody areas of the home, and took a number of physical items into evidence.[^249]   
  
They did examine the axe that had been found in the living room of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home and eliminated it as being involved in the crime as it did not test positive for blood, the material found near it had been determined to be small pieces of wood and the axe had a large amount of dust on it which indicated it hadn't been moved or used for quite some time.[^522]   
  
Further, the CSRT made note that there had been several bloody finger type impressions throughout the scene but none of them were AFIS quality (AFIS being the automated fingerprint identification system used to match against known records[^539]) nor did the these bloody finger type impression prints show any ridge detail[^537] , which could've been an indication that the suspect or suspects may have been wearing protective gloves as the attack was carried out.[^538]   
  
[Kris Kern](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/02-Kris-Kern.md#), who was an expert in crime scene reconstruction and bloodstain pattern analysis, had led the team that processed the home and created the detailed report on what had happened.[^250] [^251]    
  
And based on the initial evidence and processing of the residence, it was determined that a brutal and lethal assault against the victim began in the back bedroom[^540]  before the suspect dragged the victim into the bathroom and placed the victim in the bath tub face down.[^541]   
  
The suspect then filled the bath tub with water and ensured the victim's head had been under the water.[^542]   
  
Afterwards, the suspect walked about the hallway and kitchen during and after the crime based on the bloody foot impressions[^543] , before leaving the house via the front door.[^544]   
  
No indications of the presence of blood in the kitchen sink or on any of the knives in the kitchen had been found[^545] , and there had been no presence of blood in the bathroom sink.[^546]   
  
An experiment was later conducted in which a bath tub was filled with water to the water mark left on the tub as it had been found by the first responders[^552] , and it showed that the suspect would've had to wait close to 15 minutes for the bath tub to fill with enough water to submerge the victim.[^553]   
  
[Steve Stone](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/03-Steve-Stone.md#) who was a forensic scientist at Washington State Police, was consulted about the footwear impressions left in the blood and we'll discuss his findings later on.[^252]   
  
And [Sergeant Shelly Massey](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/04-Sergeant-Shelly-Massey.md#.md#) from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was also consulted about the bloody footprints[^253]  as [Sergeant Shelly Massey](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/04-Sergeant-Shelly-Massey.md#) was an expert on foot morphology[^254]  - again, we'll explore their findings in just a moment.  
  
[Dr Stanley Adams](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/05-Dr-Stanley-Adams.md#), who had been the assistant medical examiner for Snohomish County, had been the one to respond to the crime scene alongside Medical Examiner Investigator Don Carman.[^547]   
  
The body was examined in situ[^255]  before being removed from the bathtub and examined once more[^548] , with the body being confirmed to have been that of an adult white female[^549]  with physical features that fit the description of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^550]   
  
Though, again, due to the severity of the wounds, [Dr Stanley Adams](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/05-Dr-Stanley-Adams.md#) could not confirm the body as being [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) until they could compare the dental records.[^551] [^554]   
  
The remains were then removed to the medical examiner's office for an autopsy to be conducted.[^255]  
  
The autopsy was conducted on Wednesday the 13th of February 2013 by [Dr Stanley Adams](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/05-Dr-Stanley-Adams.md#) who had been the pathologist.[^256] [^257]   
  
The autopsy revealed that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had sustained numerous severe wounds with multiple injuries to her head and face.[^258]   
  
It also didn't find any evidence that sexual assault had taken place.[^259]   
  
Wounds that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had sustained to her arms were determined to have been defensive wounds.[^260]   
  
The significant finding in the autopsy had been that two different weapons had been used to kill [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#). [^261]   
  
It was revealed that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had water in the lungs and airway consistent with drowning[^555] , with the cause of death being determined to have been blunt force and sharp force trauma with a third component of asphyxiation by drowning.[^556]   
  
The manner of death was ruled a homicide.[^557]   
  
The detectives conducted numerous interviews with neighbours, co-workers, friends and family members of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)  and learnt several notable pieces of information.[^558]   
  
The witnesses described [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) as being "creepy", "weird" and "awkward"[^559]  and that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had not been overly interested or involved with his children prior to the separation from [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^560]   
  
One witness detailed that after the separation of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#), [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) came home one day and discovered [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) inside her home with a new girlfriend, preparing a meal.[^561]   
  
Co-workers of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) described him discussing his hatred and hostility constantly, to the degree that a supervisor at his workplace had told [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) that his continued discussion of his divorce had been disrupting the work environment.[^562]   
  
The witnesses also relayed that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had indicated that he would do whatever was necessary to stop [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) moving with the children back to Germany.[^563]   
  
On Saturday the 16th of February 2013, at approximately 2:45pm, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) and [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#) went to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s apartment to ask him a few more questions.[^262]   
  
The detectives explained that they understood [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been contacted about the positive identification of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) as the person found murdered in her bath tub[^263] , before going on to explain that they were following up with various witnesses who knew [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#). [^264]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) then invited the two detectives inside[^265] , and expressed how upset he was that [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had custody of his children.[^266]   
  
It was noted that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) never asked about his children and only stated that the police and [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had taken his kids away from him.[^565]   
  
[Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) tried to explain to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) that both [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and the police were just doing their job to make sure the children were safe and not in any danger[^267] , to which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) retorted that his attorney said he shouldn't talk to the detectives.[^268]   
  
The detectives reminded Alan that it was his choice to talk to them, but they were hoping he could help them out with any information about people that knew [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^269]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) told them that he would answer questions by stating "OK", before sitting down.[^270]   
  
The three discussed whether [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been dating the neighbour Mark again, and discussed again if [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) knew if she had been dating anyone[^271]  before discussing [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s relationship to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) again.[^272]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s answers had been very direct and non emotional when discussing [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) and her personal life.[^564]   
  
Though, it was at this point that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) told the two detectives that he had been upset by the other night and that he believed that it had been the detective's job to traumatise him.[^273]   
  
A very short conversation then occurred about [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s work, her nicknames and then his access to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house.[^274]   
  
That final point caused [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) to stand up and tell the detectives to leave.[^275]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) refused for any more photos to be taken of his hand before getting extremely close to [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) - so close that [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) became concerned for his personal safety.[^276]   
  
The detectives tried to defuse the situation by asking about the children's party[^277] , to which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) briefly responded before telling them to leave once more.[^278]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) told the detectives in this brief response that he had stayed about two or three minutes longer than the other adults at [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house[^567]  and that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had taken him by the hand and into her bedroom to show him new photos of him and the children.[^566]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) stated that these photos had been on a shelf in the bedroom, though, no photographs of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) were located on the shelves, walls or anywhere else throughout the numerous searches of the house.[^568]  [^569]   
  
This account that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) had taken [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) by the hand and taken him to the bedroom was very inconsistent with the increasing acrimony of the divorce proceedings and custody issues[^570] , especially when it was outlined in the court documents that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) claimed [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) might be sexually abusing the children and that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had called [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) a "monster" after their last court hearing.[^571]   
  
As the detectives were leaving, they invited [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and his attorney to contact them[^279]  which was when [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) revealed that he did not have a lawyer.[^280]   
  
That same day, the 16th of February, the forensic scientists from the Washington State Police Crime Lab processed Alan's SUV and they found traces of blood on the steering wheel, center console and floor mat.[^597]   
  
Traces of blood were also found on Alan's backpack[^598] , the same backpack that Alan had retrieved from his office after the interview at Boeing.[^599]   
  
On the 18th of February 2013, Bothell Police Detectives conducted a blood transfer experiment[^572]  in which they used animal blood to simulate human blood[^573]  and samples of the same type of Kleenguard coverall suit that found in [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s vehicle[^574]  to see whether the blood transfer impression could be matched.  
  
A fiberglass bath tub similar to the bath tub at the scene was purchased and set up for the experiment[^575] , with animal blood applied to test samples of the Kleenguard coveralls and pressed against the sample bath tub to simulate the blood transfer.[^576]   
  
The results of this experiment showed that there were similar characteristics to that of the blood transfer stains found on the bath tub in [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house.[^577]   
  
On the 19th of February 2013, the day after the blood transfer experiment, a professional child interview was conducted with [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s six year old daughter.[^578]   
  
During the interview, when asked about her little brother using a hatchet to chop wood, the six year old asked: "How could a 3 year old even chop wood?"[^579]   
  
The young girl proceeded to explain that her Dad ([Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)) was the only one that chopped wood and he did it outside in the hallway.[^580]   
  
The six year old then related in great detail of how her Dad, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#), had cut up apples on the morning of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body being found and that he had sprinkled cinnamon on them.[^581]  
  
The detectives noted how she had been very descriptive with how he cut the apples with a knife, took the seeds out, placed the slices on plates and sprinkled them with cinnamon [^582] before bringing the plates to them at the dining table where they all ate.[^583]   
  
Importantly, the six year old didn't mention anything about [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) cutting his finger or needing a band aid.[^584]   
  
On Thursday the 21st of February 2013, a search warrant was signed that authorised the search of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s person, apartment, Mercedes and Honda Motorcycle. [^281]   
  
The detectives decided to attempt to speak to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) prior to the warrant being executed[^282] , and so the following day on Friday the 22nd of February, at approximately 8:51am, [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) and [Detective Chissus](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/02-Detective-Chissus.md#) knocked on [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s door who answered and let them in.[^283]   
  
They told [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) that they wanted to talk to him about the investigation[^284] , and so the three of them sat at the dining room table and discussed a number of things including [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s activities over the last several days, his concerns regarding his children and [CPS](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), his travel plans, his belief that the police may have planted some blood evidence near his apartment, and what he thought might have happened to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^285]   
  
The conversation came to an end when [Detective Stone](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/03-Detective-Stone.md#) suggested that the person who had committed the murder of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) must have been feeling intense pain for their actions, and that person needed to know they could receive grace and mercy if that person were to turn themselves in and tell their side of the story.[^286]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) simply nodded his head before saying that he didn't have anything else to say.[^287]   
  
Following this, the search warrant was executed, with several electronics being seized, photographs taken of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#), and another search of his apartment taking place.[^288]   
  
On Wednesday the 27th of February 2013, a search warrant for [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s computers, cell phones, work area, GPS unit and several flash drives was caried out.[^289]   
  
The police seized three computers, two phones and 4 USB flash drives.[^290]   
  
And from [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s car, they seized his Garmin NUVI GPS unit.[^291]   
  
It's also important to note that at some point during this early investigation, the police retrieved CCTV footage from various traffic cameras surrounding [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^292]   
  
With the findings of these warrants in mind, let's take a look at a complete timeline of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s actions in the days before, the day of, and the day after the murder of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).  
  
Let's wind back the clock to the Sunday prior to the murder, the day that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) went to the theatre with her friend - the 10th of February 2013.  
  
The police examined various traffic cameras to look for vehicles belonging to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) on that evening, though, they were unable to find any matches.[^293]   
  
The following day, on Monday the 11th of February, the GPS data showed that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had dropped off his children at the day care at 7:54am, before traveling to a Albertson's parking lot - arriving at 8:10am.[^294]   
  
GPS data located his vehicle to have been in the northwest side of the parking lot where two large dumpsters had been located - and it was theorized that this had been where [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) may have disposed of various bloody items related to the murder of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^295]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) left the parking lot at 8:20am, according to the GPS data, and continued on to work.  
  
The data confirmed that he had picked up the children right after he had finished work, and that they had gone to his apartment and didn't leave that evening.[^296] [^297]   
  
Now CCTV footage showed that at 2:24am on the route from [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s apartment to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home - which was about 1.7 miles each way -, a cyclist was traveling originating from the direction of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s apartment.[^298]   
  
The quality of the video footage was poor, and the investigators were only able to make out that there had been an individual on a bicycle in the images.[^299] [^300]   
  
Traffic cameras also located a cyclist eastbound of 240th St make a left hand turn (headed northbound) onto the Bothell-Everett highway at 4:33am.[^301]   
  
That would've been the most direct route from [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s apartment.[^302]   
  
The video footage from these traffic cameras was comparable to the earlier CCTV footage - poor quality.[^303]   
  
On the day that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body was discovered, Tuesday the 12th of February, analysis of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s computers showed some interesting searches.[^305]   
  
The first search had been at 8:49am and had been an inquiry on Kayak.com for flight information from Seattle to Venezuela for 1 adult and 2 children aged 6 and 3 - which was the same ages as his two children.[^304]   
  
A second search at 9:27am on Google had been "Where is the best place to live in South Central America?"[^306]   
  
With a third subsequent search at 9:31am on Google for "Best Countries to Live and Work Abroad"[^307]   
  
These searches had been made prior to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) being told by the detectives of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s murder.[^308]   
  
It was based on these searches for flights to Venezuela with 1 adult and 2 children ages 6 and 3 that the suggestion emerged that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had been planning a trip to Venezuela for several weeks.[^585]   
  
Though his Google searches for the best places to live in south central America, and best countries to live and work abroad suggested that he might have had more permanent plans.[^586]   
  
And with the knowledge of the increasing acidic relationship between [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#), we can conclude that it would've been very unlikely that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) would have agreed to allow the children to leave the country for so long.[^587]   
  
It was also interesting to note that when [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) made those searches on the morning of the 12th of February, it had been the last day that the children were in his care before returning to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^588]   
  
GPS data from [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s car showed that he had left the Boeing plant where he worked at approximately 1:15pm.[^310]   
  
He then drove to the Everett Walmart, arriving at 1:21pm and leaving at 1:35pm.[^309] [^311]   
  
At the Walmart, he purchased a pair of croc-style shoes, two pairs of Playtex gloves, and a gas can with cash[^312]  - [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) paying with case was considered to have been unusual as he typically only paid with his debit or credit card.[^313]   
  
After making these purchases, the GPS data showed that at 1:35pm, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) drove to the location of a nearby Home Depot - arriving at 1:37pm. [^314]  [^315] [^316]   
  
Financial records then showed that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) purchased two [Kleenguard](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#) coveralls at 1:40pm, before leaving at 1:44pm.[^317] [^318]   
  
The GPS data then tracked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) as he drove to Bothell, arriving at the intersection of 240th St SE and Meridian Ave South at 2:00pm.[^319]   
  
This intersection was located several blocks away from [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home[^320] , and at the time that he had arrived at the intersection, the police had been manning a barricade that didn't allow any travel further west.[^321]   
  
It's unclear why [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had driven to the area of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home, but we know that at that time he had in his car two packages of Kleenguard coveralls, a gas can, two pairs of latex gloves, and a pair of croc style shoes.[^322]   
  
And interestingly, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) completely failed to tell the investigators in the subsequent interviews and questioning that he had gone to the Walmart or the area of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home that day.[^323]   
  
  
The GPS data then showed that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) drove back to work at the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) plant, arriving there at 2:47pm - which was 15 minutes before the detectives arrived.[^324]   
  
As we know, at 10:23pm that day, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) sent a text message to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s phone that simply said: "Hi Susi".[^589]   
  
When the digital forensics team analysed the text message history and communications between [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)[^590] , they determined that on no other occasion does [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) refer to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) as 'Susi'.[^591]   
  
He specifically addresses her as [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) on the majority of the messages, never Susi or Susan (with one n) or using any other form.[^592]   
  
In the 14 months leading up to the murder, the pair exchanged a total of 127 messages with an average of 9 messages per month[^593]  which is a considerably low number of messages.[^594]   
  
All of the messages or exchanges between [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) during that 14 month time frame were conversations in which they discussed transferring the children back and forth or other issues related to the children or between them.[^595]   
  
In fact, in no other messages does [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) ever simply write "Hi".[^596]   
  
On Wednesday the 13th of February, on the day after [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body was discovered and on the day of the autopsy, the GPS data indicated that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had left his home at 4:25am and headed south on the I-405, exiting the I-405 in Bellevue at the NE 8th St exit, making a U-turn and getting back on the I-405.[^325]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) then continued back north on the I-405, ultimately ending his journey at his workplace at the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) plant at 5:29am.[^326]   
  
Again, it's unclear why [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) drove to Renton in the early hours of the morning, though it was clear that the drive had been unprecedented based on the historical GPS data.[^327]   
  
At 5:53am, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) performed another search for flights to South America.[^328]   
  
And at 6:06am, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) searched on Kayak.com for flight information for a flight from Seattle to Venezuela for only 1 adult.[^329]   
  
During the course of the work day, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) made four separate cash withdrawals from an ATM at the [Boeing](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/02-Boeing.md#.md#) plant, with the total amount being $1,500.[^330]   
  
These movements and transactions were omitted from [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s recounting of his activities in any of the interviews he had with the detectives.  
  
Now on Friday the 1st of March 2013, a Bothell man contacted the police about a [Bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#.md#) that he had noticed had been left unattended for several days at business and apartment complexes around the Canyon Park neighbourhood - which was where [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) lived.[^331]   
  
The police logged this abandoned bicycle into the Bothell police evidence room that same day.[^332]   
  
The following week, on Friday the 8th of March 2013, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) went to the Bothell police department to pick up the keys to his car as his car had been seized as part of the search warrant.[^333]   
  
While he was there, the detectives asked him if they could question him further, to which he refused - telling them that his attorney had advised him against further questioning.[^334]   
  
And as they had been unable to locate [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s passport during the searches of his apartment, work place and vehicles[^602] , they asked [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) where it was and reinstated that there was an authorisation to seize his passport under the authority of a search warrant.[^603]   
  
Though, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) declined to hand over his passport at that time.[^604]   
  
On the 12th[^335]  and on the 28th of March 2013[^336] , and on the 10th of April 2013[^337] , four search warrants were signed that authorised the search of Alan's financial accounts and cell phone - I've included the data from the financial accounts in the timeline of events we just discussed.  
  
In early April of 2013, it was reported that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had spoken to one of the neighbours of [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and told them that he had been planning on moving back into [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^338]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had already changed the locks on the house, and had [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s vehicle removed from the premisis.[^339]   
  
The police instructed the neighbours to not have any contact with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#).[^340]   
  
On the 21st of April, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) moved into [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home with his new girlfriend at the time[^341]  - 32 year old [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#)[^342] - we'll touch on this new relationship shortly.  
  
The detectives also learnt on that day that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#) had been considering "getting out of the country" and going to South America to avoid the police.[^605]   
  
On Wednesday the 24th of April 2013, a detective checked the serial numbers of the bicycle that had been taken into evidence and confirmed that it had been the same bicycle as the one that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had purchased in November of the previous year via serial number records.[^343]   
  
The bicycle was subsequently photographed and packaged before being sent to be processed and analysed for latent prints, DNA and other trace materials.[^344]   
  
On Friday the 14th of June 2013, the police tracked down a truck driver that had been seen in the CCTV footage of the bicycle traveling in the early morning hours of February 11th.[^345]   
  
The police asked the truck driver whether he had seen a cyclist[^346] , though it is important to note that this interview took place four months after the event took place and memory is a feeble thing.[^347]   
  
During this interview, the truck driver said that he remembered seeing a man on a bike one night in February[^348] , though he couldn't give an exact date he did state that it had been a Monday.[^349]   
The truck driver explained that he had only glanced at the man on the bike twice[^350] , but could describe him as wearing dark clothing with a grizzled or unkempt look.[^351]   
  
It's important to note that the truck driver failed to mention any specific article or clothing or any specific features of the cyclist.[^352]   
  
On the 18th of June 2013, Boeing sent [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) a notice that stated that he had been put on leave without pay after being on paid leave since the end of February.  
  
In the evening of Wednesday the 19th of June 2013, neighbours to [The Smith House](../../50-to-59-Investigation/52-Key-Locations/04-The-Smith-House.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) which was where [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had now been living phoned for the police after they heard a woman screaming.[^353]   
  
When the police arrived, they found [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and his new girlfriend [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#) having sex in the backyard.[^354]   
  
No charges were filed against them[^355] , but the neighbours also complained about nude sunbathing (which [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#) claimed would've been very hard for them to see.)[^356]   
  
[Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) alleged that they had found threatening notes left on the property, but she didn't know who had put them there.[^357]   
  
On either Saturday the 22nd or Sunday the 23rd of June 2013, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were told that due to the ongoing publicity surrounding the investigation into [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s murder, they were no longer welcome to attend services at City Church's Seattle or Kirkland church campus.[^358]   
  
And being turned away from the City Church deeply upset both [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^359]   
  
We know, though, that on Sunday the 23rd of June 2013, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) phoned up [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#) who [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had met at a potluck organised by City Church.[^360]   
  
[Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) had been an ordained minister, though its important to establish that he had not been employed by City Church .[^361]   
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#) asked [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) over the phone whether they could meet up at a Starbucks on South Lake Union[^362]  - to which [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) agreed.[^363]   
  
When [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) arrived at the Starbucks with his wife and went inside, [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) approached him and told him that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was outside in his car and that he needed support.[^364]   
  
[Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) then promptly went to [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s car to find [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) upset.[^365]   
  
While [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#)' wife spoke inside of the Starbucks, [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) spoke inside of [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s car.[^366]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) appeared distraught to [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#), as he stated that his life was in "chaos" and that he felt "trapped by tornadoes all around him", and that he was in over his head dealing with the mental issues of [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^367]   
  
Wendell told [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) that he had come to point [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) to the Lord, and to the Word of God.[^368]   
  
Though, Wendell explained that before he could help and support him, he needed to know whether he had anything to do with his wife's murder.[^369]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) didn't respond to this question immediately, taking a moment before suggesting that they take a walk.[^370]   
  
According to Wendell, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) appeared to look around and express concern as to how "safe" the area was.[^371]   
  
And Wendell then told [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) that whatever he said would stay between the two of them.[^372]   
  
As [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) and Wendell were walking, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) turned to Wendel and stated:[^373]   
  
>[!quote] [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#)   
>*About what you asked me in the car, the answer is yes.*  
  
Wendell took a moment  (**note: this is the author's inference**) before asking him to clarify.[^374]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) told him:[^375]   
  
>[!quote] [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#)   
>*Yes, I did it to her.*  
  
It was at that point that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) broke down, sobbing and crying[^376]  , before telling Wendell:[^377]   
  
>[!quote] [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#)   
>*I respect what you do with the information because at this point I am walking off the ledge, I'm walking off the ledge.*  
  
[Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) would later explain that it had been his belief that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) was going to turn himself into the police[^378] , and that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s comment had meant that he had [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s permission to take his statements to the authorities.[^379]   
  
The pair continued their conversation, and at some point [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) indicated that he would like to be baptised.[^380]   
  
[Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) decided that they could go that day to get [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) baptised to the Citadel church in Des Moines as it had been open late[^381] , though when they arrived, they discovered that church did not have a baptistery.[^382]   
  
The pair eventually parted ways, and over the next few days, [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) contacted [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) via phone and text messages and tried to persuade him to speak with the authorities.[^383]   
  
By the time Tuesday the 27th of June 2013 came around, and after [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had still failed to come forward with his confession to the authorities, [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) called the police.[^384]   
  
When he spoke with the authorities, he was adamant that he had not been acting as a clergyman when he spoke with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), but merely as a man of God.[^385]   
  
It was on that same day, Tuesday the 27th of June, that results of the analysis on the bloody footprints, bloodstain impressions and other forensic comparisons were completed.  
  
The forensic scientist [Steve Stone](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/03-Steve-Stone.md#) concluded that the impressions in blood that were found on the bathtub were consistent with a coveralls type of suit that the police had learnt [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had purchased in October of 2012 and on the 12th of February 2013.[^386]   
  
Further, [Steve Stone](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/03-Steve-Stone.md#) found that croc-style shoes - the same kind that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had purchased - were consistent with leaving some of the prints found at the scene.[^387]   
  
The police actually, in their investigation, purchased an identical pair of shoes and asked their crime lab to compare the soles of the shoes to the impressions left in blood at the scene[^389] , and the forensic scientist concluded that "the shoes can be included in the possible designs that correspond to this impression".[^390]   
  
Notably, though, the croc-style shoes that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had purchased have not been recovered by the police during any of their searches.[^395]   
  
[Sergeant Shelly Massey](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/04-Sergeant-Shelly-Massey.md#.md#) found, after examining photos of the bloody footprints and comparing them to known impressions of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s feet that there was support for the hypothesis that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had left the bloody footprint.[^388]   
  
It was also determined by [Dr Stanley Adams](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/05-Dr-Stanley-Adams.md#), the pathologist, that the type of mallet that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had purchased in October of 2012[^391]  would match both the wound patterns documented photographically, and the nature of the blunt force injuries suffered by [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^392]   
  
Another forensic scientist called [Kathy Geil](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/06-Kathy-Geil.md#) also examined the photographs of the injuries and the mallet and indicated that the mallet was consistent with the wound patterns documented.[^393]   
  
[Kathy Geil](../../70-to-79-People/76-Experts/06-Kathy-Geil.md#) also noted that from looking at the photographs of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body that the sole intent of her assailant had been to kill her.[^394]   
  
Also on that Tuesday the 25th of June, charges were filed against [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) for obstructing for refusing to turn over his passport as directed by court order.[^396]   
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) posted a $10,000 bond for the obstruction charges the following day on the 26th of June.[^397]   
  
Though, on the 27th of June, at approximately 8:00am, multiple members of the Bothell Police went to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s home to arrest him for the murder of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^398]   
  
Two detectives knocked on [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s door,[^399]  and when he answered[^400] , they told him that they had spoken to [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) and that it was time to finish what he and [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) had started.[^401]   
  
During this contact, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) opted to not talk with the detectives.[^402]   
  
He was advised that he was under arrest for murder, and was handcuffed.[^403]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) was then transported to the Bothell Police Department[^404]  where he was read his Miranda Warnings at 9:15am[^405]  - no further questioning took place.[^406]   
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was charged with first degree murder with a deadly weapon, with the aggravating factor of domestic violence[^407]  and was held in custody on a bail of $1,000,000.[^408]   
  
The press published the charges and arrest the following day.[^409]   
# Legal Proceedings  
  
On the 7th of July 2013, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s girlfriend [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) posted to Facebook and told the Report that she was pregnant with [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s child - providing ultrasound scans.[^410]   
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) then appeared in court for the misdemeanour charge of obstruction on Monday the 23rd of September 2013[^411] , and notably his girlfriend [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been present to defend him.[^412]   
  
There were numerous pre-trial hearings that took place from September 2013 through to April of 2014 which I'll pop the dates and details on screen now for the sake of brevity.[^413] [^414] [^415] [^416] [^417]   
  
Tragically, on the 9th of April 2014, [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was found deceased after taking her own life.[^418]   
  
The King's County Medical Examiner's Office noted the marks around her neck[^419]  though they could not confirm if [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had still been pregnant at the time of her death.[^420]   
  
Which is bizarre to me but, that's outside the scope of this coverage. (**note: this is the author's inference**)  
  
Following the death of [Love Thai](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/03-Love-Thai.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), the trial date which had originally been set for the 2nd of May 2014 was moved to the 13th of June 2014[^421] , which was then moved again to the 12th of January 2015.[^422]   
  
The trial against [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) commenced on Monday the 12th of January 2015[^423] , and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) waived his right to a jury trial which meant the verdict in his case would be rendered by the trial court itself.[^424]   
  
The trial came to a close on the 4th of February 2015, almost 2 years to the day of the murder.[^425]   
  
The trial court gave its oral decision, which included its findings of fact and conclusions of law.[^426]   
  
Let's take a look at the oral decision. (this is all taken from: [02-Detailed-Timeline](../../50-to-59-Investigation/53-Timeline/02-Detailed-Timeline.md#kfxhe))  
  
The trial court noted in its findings that there was substantial circumstantial evidence suggesting [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s involvement in the crime.  
  
In particular, the court found that at the time of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s death, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were in the midst of contentious dissolution proceedings, with [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) obsessed with the dissolution, and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) frequently expressing his frustrations about the dissolution proceedings to co-workers and family members.  
  
[Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) also expressed concern that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) would take their two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) back to her native Germany.  
  
The trial court found that in the fall of 2012, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) made statements to a woman he was involved with that he would like [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to disappear, and [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) asked the woman if she knew of anyway to "*get rid of*" someone.  
  
At around the same time, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) purchased a rubber [mallet](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/04-Mallet.md#.md#.md#.md#) and [disposable coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#) - items which were consistent with the murder weapon and fabric impressions found at the murder scene.  
  
The trial court found that forensic evidence obtained at the crime scene included a [DNA](../../60-to-69-Evidence/62-Forensic/05-DNA.md#.md#.md#) match to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) on a washcloth located under [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body in the bathtub, and blood footprints that could have been made by [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).  
  
The trial court noted in its oral findings that in the early morning hours of [02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#), a man was seen riding a bike on a route that could lead to [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house and, a couple of hours later, the same man was seen riding a bike in the opposite direction on a route that could lead to [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house.  
  
Evidence was also presented that a [bicycle](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/02-Bicycle.md#.md#.md#) that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had recently purchased was later found abandoned near [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s apartment complex.  
  
The trial court also found that the [GPS](../../60-to-69-Evidence/61-Digital/03-Garmin-GPS.md#) evidence showed some suspicious and unusual travel by [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) on [02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#) and [03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#).  
  
In particular, on the morning of [02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/02-2013-02-11-Monday-February-11th-2013.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) made an unexplained detour to the area of some dumpsters.  
  
On [03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#.md#), [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) left work midday and made stops at Walmart and Home Depot where he purchased [disposable coveralls](../../60-to-69-Evidence/63-Physical/03-Kleenguard.md#.md#.md#.md#), masking tape, croc-style shoes with soles consistent with bloody footprints found at the murder scene, latex gloves, and a gas can, before driving to the area of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s residence, which was at that time barricaded by police.  
  
 Additional suspicious activity noted by the trial court included various internet searches, including searches for flights to Venezuela for one adult and two [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) on the morning of [03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013](../../10-to-19-Case-Dates/12-Crime-Dates/03-2013-02-12-Tuesday-February-12th-2013.md#.md#), and a modified search for flights for one adult after [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s [children](../../70-to-79-People/73-Family-and-Friends/08-Children.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) were placed with [Child Protective Services](../../70-to-79-People/75-Police-and-Detectives/08-CPS.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).  
  
After detailing the circumstantial evidence suggestion [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s likely involvement in the crime, the trial court went on to explain that none of the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was guilty of the crime of murdering [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#), but that the evidence must be considered in light of [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s interactions with [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#) to whom [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) confessed.  
  
The trial court concluded that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s confession to [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#), in combination with the other evidence presented at trial, established beyond a reasonable doubt that [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was responsible for the murder of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#).  
  
The Court convicted [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) of Murder in the First Degree after hearing the better part of three weeks testimony prior to reaching this verdict.  
  
The sentencing hearing was set for Monday the 23rd of February 2015 at 1:30pm.[^427]   
  
Prior to this sentencing hearing taking place, the State filed their sentencing memorandum which essentially argued for how long he should be sentenced for.  
  
You see, due to murder in the first degree being a level XV, or 15, offense[^428]  and the fact that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had no prior criminal history[^430] ; he was eligible for a sentencing range from 240 months, or 20 years, to 320 months, or just over 26 and a half years.[^429]   
  
Though, because [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had been armed with a deadly weapon at the time of the offense, an additional 24 months or two years would be added to the top and the bottom of this sentencing range so 22 years to 28 and a half years.  
  
On top of that, due to the fact that the crime had been on of Domestic Violence[^431] , an additional 36 months of community custody is added.  
  
It had been the State's recommendation that [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) be sentenced to the higher end of the range, for 344 months or 28 and a half years.[^432]   
  
When looking at the facts of this case, it is hard to imagine a more calculated, arrogant and selfish act of violence[^433]  and that the murder of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) had been no "heat of the moment" event.[^434]   
  
You see, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) selected a time when [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) would be the least likely to be able to defend herself, and when it would've been least likely that anyone could witness any part of the crime and try to prevent it.[^435]   
  
[Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) took multiple steps in an effort to decrease the chances that he would leave any forensic evidence for the authorities to find.[^436]   
  
He even used his own children as props in his story to the police, holding them as proof that he did not venture out into the night and "kill the mother of his children".[^437]   
  
His arrogance completely manifested itself in his belief that he was smarter than anyone else, and that if he just planned his attack on [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) well enough then he would be able to get away with murder.[^438]   
  
And looking at all the evidence in this case, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) approached this vicious and brutal attack just like he would have done any other problem at his work; that is, with enough thought and engineering - anything could be managed.[^439]   
  
This was exemplified by the way in which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) planned the attack, and the way in which he carried himself in the days immediately following the discovery of [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s body.[^440]   
  
He genuinely believed that he had thought of everything - using the cover of darkness to hide him as he cycled over to [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s house, wearing protective gear, disposing of the gloves and crocs and coveralls used in the attack, and fabricating a story he whole-heartedly believed could not be disproved.[^441]   
  
All of this effort, all of this planning, all of this engineering of a murder, just for [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s downfall to be both the various items he failed to account for, and by his own breakdown and unravelling when his life after the murder did not turn out the way he had planned and hoped.[^442]   
  
The degree to which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s selfishness will impact the lives of [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s family - her parents, her sister - and their two young children is impossible to overstate.[^443]   
  
His attempts to prevent his children from going with their mother to Germany saw [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) go to great lengths to defame a woman whom all evidence indicates devoted her life to her children and to the church.[^444]   
  
All of this because he feared that the children might be moved to Germany at some point, after all of this planning, after all of this violence, [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) has essentially orphaned his two young children in a final act of complete selfishness.[^445]   
  
The revolting and grotesque manner in which [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#) had treated [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#) both during the attack and afterwards by leaving her in a state that I couldn't bare to describe within this video speaks volumes as to the lack of care and thought he had for anybody else besides himself.[^446]   
  
The horrific nightmarish scene that he had left in blood at the home where his children lived amplified [Alan](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#)'s selfish thought process - thinking of nobody but himself.[^447]   
  
I simply cannot overstate and exaggerate the cold-blooded viciousness of the attack on [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#).[^451]   
  
The location of her injuries, the vast number of injuries she suffered, the use of two different weapons, and the fact he placed her in the bathtub once she had been rendered completely helpless demonstrates his lack of care for anyone but him - his single-mindedness.[^448]   
  
The pain and horror that [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) likely suffered in her final moments is disturbing to contemplate.[^449]   
  
The State requested that the court imposed the high end of 344 months[^450] , and that the Court impose 36 months of community custody after [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s release, and impose the standard financial conditions.  
  
The State also requested that the Court order [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) to have no contact with [Susann Smith](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s family[^452] , and have no contact with either of his two children until they reach the age of 18.[^453]   
  
The sentencing hearing against [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) took place on Thursday the 5th of March 2015.  
  
And taking the State's Memorandum into consideration, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was sentenced to the high end sentence of 344 months imprisonment, and a further 36 months community custody on 1 count of First Degree Murder with a Deadly Weapon (relating to Domestic Violence).[^454]   
  
Alan filed notice of his appeal of the sentence on the 9th of March 2015.[^456]   
  
In his appeal declaration, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) wrote that the Court erred in 9 different motions, notably that The Court erred in denying the motion to suppress [Wendell Morris](../../70-to-79-People/74-Witnesses/02-Wendell-Morris.md#.md#)' testimony due to the priest-penitent privilege.  
  
He also claimed that his attorneys provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to present evidence, failing to cross examine the state's witnesses properly, failing to call necessary defence witnesses to establish crucial facts, failing to submit all requested materials for sentencing, and by failing to communicate with him adequately through the course of the case.[^457]   
  
On the 13th of June 2016, [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) filed a pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Washington Supreme Court[^455]  to challenge his commitment ort criminal conviction to another facility or the conditions under which he was being held.[^459]  
  
On the 9th of January 2017, the Court of Appeals for the State of Washington issued an unpublished opinion that affirmed [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s conviction following his appeal[^458]  - effectively striking down each and every ground he had appealed on.  
  
And on the 2nd of August 2017, his pro se petition for review that he had filed with the Supreme Court for writ of habeas corpus was denied for review without comment.[^460]   
  
Finally, on the 11th of August 2018, the Washington Court of Appeals issued its mandate which terminated direct review[^461]  - [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) was locked behind bars until the end of his sentence.  
  
## Conclusion   
  
We can only hope that [Susann](../../70-to-79-People/71-Victims/02-Susann-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#)'s family, her children and her friends have been able to find justice in the sentencing brought against [Alan Smith](../../70-to-79-People/72-Suspects-and-People-of-Interest/02-Alan-Smith.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#.md#) and that they are able to move forward with their loving memories of her in their hearts.  
  
And that's everything I have for you in this case.  
  
But just before you go, I just wanted to let you know that from this case forward, I will be publishing my entire research project alongside the fully cited script with all the case files and imagery I come across when I delve into a case.  
  
This is not only in an act of wanting complete transparency with you, but also due to the fact that I cover a lot of lesser-known cases that deserve the attention.  
  
If you're a true crime content creator, you are more than welcome to use my research as a basis for your own coverage - so long as you leave a link to the research and give credit.  
  
Let's work together to amplify victim stories, and get them the public attention they deserve.  
  
I don't see any point or need to gatekeep the research that I spend the vast amount of my time on, especially as a lot of case files and sources are paywalled.  
  
You can find my true crime research repo at www.truecrimecases.com  
  
You will also be able to find a direct link to a specific case in the description box underneath my video on it.  
  
Again, this is just for my cases going forward, and I've not quite perfected the website as of yet so I'll be trying to update when I can.  
  
You can also leave comments on my research so if you find any additional information, you can add it there too.  
  
And with all that being said, I'll see you in the next case.
